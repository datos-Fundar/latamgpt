## Abstract

Governments are one of the world's largest generators and users of data. As such, they usually carry open data initiatives to release data for public use. The G20 has played a pivotal role in endorsing open data principles, particularly addressing data privacy and personal protection since the Hangzhou's Leader's Communique in 2016 and reinforcing it in later meetings (Branford-White, 2017; Godhwani et al., 2023).

Data openness is a crucial movement that empowers civil citizens and organizations, allowing  them  to  make  conscious  and  informed  choices.  Nevertheless,  open  data initiatives sometimes face challenges while handling personal information and privacy. Creating protocols and benchmarks on database catalogues can address these situations. In addition, it is essential to include good practices for data anonymization to avoid reidentifying individuals on the basis of their personal data.

This policy brief is built upon two cases where open data portals and data privacy are at  a  crossroads: the protection of children's privacy in the criminal justice system and using sensitive worker information. These examples are intended to provide a broad and global perspective on the data protection issues since they reflect the experience and work of two different think tanks from different regions.

The G20 can encourage developing and adopting agreed protocols and guidelines to balance data privacy and open data. This policy brief outlines key considerations that governments should consider to implement safe and responsible data protection policies, taking the aforementioned examples to discuss the application of this framework. Data sharing facilitates evidence-based policymaking and fosters transparency, stressing the importance of creating a framework for data protection in the public sector.

## Diagnosis of the Issue

Every time citizens fill out government forms, open a company, or pay their taxes, they share information with an agency that is probably storing it. Governments are, in fact, one of the largest data generators in the world. They also consume data: to make informed decisions, enhance service delivery, promote innovation and design more efficient and effective public policies. To work with data it is necessary to ensure information is stored safely since it might contain sensitive citizenship information.

Governments usually carry out open data initiatives to release data for public use. Data openness is a movement that empowers citizens and organizations, allowing them to make conscious and informed choices. Furthermore, enhancing data sharing between government agencies is desirable to make public policy decisions. Nevertheless, such initiatives face challenges while handling personal information and privacy.

The  G20  has  played  a  pivotal  role  in  endorsing  open  data  principles,  particularly addressing data privacy and personal protection since the Leader's Communique in 2016 and reinforcing it later (Branford-White, 2017; Godhwani et al., 2023). Moreover, the UN has stressed the importance of having quality data to implement and monitor progress on the  Sustainable  Development  Goals  (SDGs)  and  the  need  for  a  'new  open  data management framework' to foster innovation (UN, 2017; UN, 2022).

## · Case Study 1: Protection of children's privacy in the criminal justice system

This  section  addresses  the  challenges  and  necessities  of  balancing  privacy  and transparency in judicial proceedings, particularly in cases involving sexual crimes and children. Increasingly, in India, orders and judgments pertaining to cases of sexual crimes

are not being made available on the e-Courts 1 portal. The non-availability of relevant information affects the right to information of the parties in a case, making them fully dependent on their counsels, and increasing their vulnerability to corrupt and exploitative practices. It also hampers bona fide research, review and social audits that are necessary for  good  governance. Keeping in mind the fact  that information concerning a case is confidential  and  any  information  on  a  public  platform  revealing  the  identity  of  the victim/survivor can be detrimental to their rehabilitation and well-being and would be a violation of their rights, there is a need to identify a way to achieve the twin goals of privacy and confidentiality of victims and witnesses and judicial data transparency, access and accountability.

A particularly sensitive case relates to situations involving children since they must be especially protected from the damaging effects of engaging in the criminal justice system. The protection of children from all forms of violence is recognized in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and in SDG 16. Hence, it is mandatory to protect them from the  persecution  and  stigmatization  they  might  suffer  from  their  involvement  in  these cases.  Some  previous  work  has  dealt  with  this  issue,  (Elder  et  al.  2020),  where recommendations and practices in protecting children's confidentiality were given.

## · Case Study 2: Usage of sensitive worker information

This  section  will  discuss  the  initiatives  by  the  Ministry  of  Culture  of Argentina  to enhance data-driven governance and transparency in the cultural sector. The Ministry of Culture of Argentina created the Federal Registry of Culture (FRC) in 2021, during the COVID-19 pandemic. On the registry's website, people working in the cultural sector

could enroll and create a profile to apply to programs of the Ministry. The registry is also processed to create management tools for the government.

Additionally,  the  registry  allows  to  characterize  the  population  targeted  by  the Ministry's  policy.  This  diverse  population  includes  some  profiles  as  set  designers, craftsmen, musicians, illuminators and teachers of artistic disciplines, among others. It also covers a wide spectrum of recipients in terms of geographical location, employment status, income, age and gender identity. It is also the first administrative registry of the Ministry to include a question about belonging to indigenous communities (Directorate for Management Planning and Monitoring, 2023). The registry also integrates data from other government sources to characterize the population targeted by cultural policies. It is necessary to have this granularity as part of the Ministry's objectives is to implement public policies that promote the visibility of cultural diversity.

Regarding the data availability, the "Culture in Data" website 2 was created to publish the databases. Data  confidentiality is ensured  by  restricting access to sensitive information  exclusively  to  authorized  personnel  from  the  Ministry  and  through  an anonymization process so the citizens can use this data without compromising the identity and privacy of those included in the registry.

## Recommendations

Promoting an inclusive world in an increasingly digitalized environment is essential. In order to address issues such as poverty, inequality or climate change, governments and international organizations need to have tools to diagnose and measure the impact of their actions. For that reason, this policy brief encourages the countries of the G20 to produce, share and use data in innovative ways to tackle the challenges of sustainable development.

One  opportunity  governments  have  to  include  new  data  sources  is  by  exploiting administrative registers to extract valuable information from them, like the mentioned example of the Federal Registry of Culture. The registry was a precious case as a part of it  was a displaced and marginalized population that was not included in other official administrative registers. The digitalization and use of data from the judicial system is also essential, not only to hold this system accountable but also to analyze how sentences are handed down and to monitor its functioning.

However, governments need to consider the consequences of dealing with sensitive data and find ways to protect the integrity of personal information. Nowadays, collecting personal and user information is quite usual, beyond the specific information that each database provides. Identity preservation is a right of citizenship and an obligation of the person or agency that safeguards the information. The informed consent must clarify how data will be used and whether it will be retained or deleted after its use: citizens must have control over how their data is used. Both  primary uses  (for which the data was collected)  and  secondary  uses  (subsequent  uses  for  other  purposes,  or  uses  of  data collected by other entities or for different objectives) should be considered.

In this sense, states should have accessible and clear legislation relating to how privacy interacts with sensitive cases. To take an example, the judicial system should determine

whether  or  not  access  is  to  be  granted  regarding  case  records  through  the  relevant legislation. A  process  to  access  court  records  substantiated  in  legislation  would  be  a significant step towards promoting judicial accountability and demonstrates the willingness of the court system to commit to the concept of open justice.

Once the legal processes are considered and it is decided to open and share data with personal information, it is necessary to carry out an anonymization process to preserve the  identity  and  privacy  of  the  individual.  Certainly,  not  every  information  exchange carries the same risk: making a database public, as in the case of the registry is not the same  as  sharing  it  between  secretariats  of  the  same  ministry.  Hence,  before  sharing information we should check two important things.

First of all, the content of the database should be checked. Not all data is sensitive or personal and should be treated similarly. All countries and government agencies should have their own data catalogue that declares how sensitive the information in each database is. After creating the catalogues, governments should create protocols based on them so they know where they need to be careful. Secondly, potential users of the database should be checked. There are different degrees of data openness: inside the organization, to external people, and to the public. There should be a protocol for which data can be shared with other members of the organization. For example, the registry might be shared among members of the Ministry of Culture of Argentina if they work in an authorized area and can be partially anonymized. But in the case of opening data to the public, there should be more assiduous work in the anonymization.

After both those points are considered, some decisions should be made to share data. According  to  the  outlined  protocols,  if  the  data  is  shared  among  members  of  the organization or other teams that have signed some agreements of non-disclosure of the information, then deleting variables such as names, email addresses, cell phone numbers

<!-- image -->

and addresses is enough. If data is going to be open to a wider audience, we can follow the steps below -based on (Yankelevich, Daniel 2021) and (Luvini, P. 2022)- to handle sensitive data carefully:

1. Identify data: Analyze all the variables in the database and consider whether they can  be  cross-referenced  with  other  external  data  sources  that  allow  for  the  reidentification of individuals. If any of these variables are sensitive to cross-referencing, then they should be masked or encrypted. If some variables are partially masked, there is a greater chance that the citizens will be identified. For instance, the Federal Registry of Culture collected glocalization data that if it was left, individuals would be very easily identified in places with low population density.
2. Identify risks: Data encryption should be prioritized and will depend on the risk and  usage  scenarios.  Suppose  the  risk  of  citizens  being  re-identified  is  high  and  will violate  their  identity  or  have  implications  for  their  lives.  In  that  case,  this  must  be prevented  by  modifying  and  anonymizing  the  database.  For  instance,  if  children  are involved in some part of a judicial case their identity should be preserved at least until they  reach  adulthood  and  can  decide  whether  or  not  to  keep  their  anonymity.  This empowering feature allows victims of sexual crimes for example to take autonomy over their own lives.
3. Identify solutions: Some techniques can help avoid personal data identification. First,  we  should  remove  unnecessary  columns  with  sensitive  information,  and  the remaining ones that might be dangerous can be hashed and encrypted. In some cases, it will also be necessary to group data and give up some granularity. Some measures taken in children protection cases were to employ name suppression techniques, such as using initials or pseudonyms, and some redaction mechanisms to remove or erase from a record before it is shared.

4. Identify attacks and problems: Considering that attacks can evolve and change through time, it is important to check periodically for new risks. If there exists a potential database  to  be  crossed  with  the  one  we  are  sharing  that  would  allow  some  reidentification, we should consider it while anonymizing and encrypting.

## Scenario of Outcomes

Opening  and  sharing  data  will  always  have  a  tight  relationship  with  protecting sensitive information. In this policy brief, we have identified some steps and protocols that the governments of the G20 can follow to open data. This framework is quite general, leaving some space for countries to be specific in their benchmark and standards. In this section, we will list the advantages and disadvantages that the proposed framework of open data has.

First, we would like to highlight that opening and sharing data is important to make public  policy  decisions  based  on  evidence  and  to  enhance  transparency. As  we mentioned, opening data is not a goal on its own, it is also about what that data can be used for. Sharing data safely among agencies and teams of the government can bring a lot of  benefits  like  making  innovative  analyses  to  provide  public  policy-makers  with information and tools.

For instance, the Federal Registry of Culture was originally a website where people could enroll in the Ministry's programs but the information it gathered was transformed into a tool to segment groups of people who needed different assistance from the state (Avenburg, A. et al. 2022). To do so, the Ministry's office in charge of the database had to share it with a different organization, thus anonymizing data to secure the identity of those people from the database. By doing this, they were able to do a cluster analysis of

<!-- image -->

the database and identify different groups and profiles based on the existing data. To do this kind of segmentation is crucial to fight poverty and inequality, because not every displaced group has the same needs or demands, hence the policy we can do to help them will vary.

Children's protection in the justice system is another great example of how we can pursue  inclusive  development  by  using  data.  The  2020  SDG  report  pointed  out  that 'Sexual violence, one of the most disturbing violations of children's rights, is widely underreported.'  due  to  the  lack  of  comparable  data  across  countries  (UN,  2020). Recommendations such as those stated in this policy brief and in (Elder et al. 2020) pave the way for progress in this goal. First and foremost, we need to understand and diagnose the issues we face in order to find solutions to them.

On the other hand, anonymizing and protecting personal data is a complex task. There  is  more  than  one  example  of  intended  anonymized  databases  that  were  later reidentified. In some cases, the steps mentioned above were not strictly followed and in other cases, a new dataset was published that allowed cross-checking the information and identifying  the  persons  or  organizations  in  the  database.  A  case  in  point  was  from (Narayanan  and  Shmatikov,  2008),  who  demonstrated  that  a  database  of  anonymous movie  ratings  of  Netflix  users  could  be  reidentified,  uncovering  the  users'  political preferences and other sensitive information. This case was a huge scandal that led the company to a court trial and to shut down all the competitions it had in place using its customer's supposedly anonymous information.

## Conclusion

Overall, this policy brief aimed to set a framework to enhance data protection. As we previously mentioned, fostering such kind of policies that protect personal data is a means to an end, not an end in itself. To increase the interoperability among government agencies or to share more datasets with the public needs to be a greater goal than just increasing the open data portals. Information availability is fundamental to improving public policy decision-making and scientific investigations. However, sharing data is not free: there is a high cost to be paid to obtain data protection. As pointed out before, citizens have the right  to  keep  their  data  and  identities  private,  so  data  protection  and  anonymization techniques should be implemented. Such solutions are not free of certain risks and attacks that databases can suffer.

Throughout the policy brief, we have stated the benefits and the challenges that arise when a database is shared or opened. Finding the balance between access to personal data for decision-making and privacy is a hard task that governments of the G20 should face. To tackle the challenges of our time it is mandatory to capture new data sources and to use existing information in novel ways.

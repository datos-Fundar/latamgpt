## Abstract

The new environmental regulations aimed at ensuring sustainable trade in commodity supply  chains,  exemplified  by  the  EU  Deforestation  Regulation  (EUDR),  represent  a significant  step  towards  tackling  global  environmental  issues  such  as  climate  change, deforestation,  and  biodiversity  loss.  However,  international  trade  should  not  only  be greener but also more just and inclusive, ensuring that the benefits and burdens of these measures  are  evenly  shared  among  all  countries  and  societal  groups.  Developing Countries  (DCs)  and  Least  Developed  Countries  (LDCs),  but  also  certain  vulnerable groups  like  smallholder  farmers,  risk  being  disproportionately  affected  by  these  new regulations, with potential detrimental effects on economic growth, human development, and  integration  within  the  global  trade  system.  These  obstacles  stem  from  increased production costs, potential competitiveness loss and complex compliance requirements.

This brief delves into these hurdles and outlines immediate actions that the G20 should undertake in response. Even though there is no one-size-fits-all solution, the G20 can provide guidelines to address these shared challenges in three critical dimensions:

- I. Participatory governance: fostering multilateralism, open participation mechanisms and polycentric institutions.
- II. Capacity  building:  funding  technological  infrastructure,  supplying  technical assistance and supporting transparency tools.
- III. Economic incentives:  designing  and  implementing  market  mechanisms  that promote sustainable production.

The  G20  must  play  a  key  role  in  outlining  policy  strategies  that  comprehensively integrate climate change, trade, and agrifood systems, and guarantee the participation of DCs and LDCs, in order to achieve SDGs worldwide.

Keywords: trade, deforestation, due diligence regulations, EUDR, commodities, supply chains.

## Diagnosis of the issue

International trade affects climate change through many channels. Notably, trade in agricultural  goods  is  a  major  driver  of  deforestation,  land-use  change  and biodiversity loss . Agricultural expansion of globally traded commodities such as soy, beef, and palm oil, is responsible for almost 90% of tropical deforestation (Pendrill et al. 2022). This is critical since, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), no further deforestation can occur from 2030 to meet the 1.5 C° target (Rogelj et al. 2018).

The empirical evidence shows the tight connection between trade and deforestation. Pendrill et al. (2019) estimated that, in the period spanning 2010 to 2014, 29-39% of deforestation-related emissions were attributable to international trade. This highlights that trade policies can be leveraged as climate action tools by shaping global patterns of consumption, production, and land use.

In recent years, many initiatives have been launched to address deforestation in agro commodities global supply chains. The number of Voluntary Sustainability Standards (VSS)  has  increased  with  the  primary  agricultural  producer's  sector  representing  the biggest  share  of  this  sustainability  standards  landscape  (Papendieck  and  McNamara 2024). However, the growing complexity of their requirements and their voluntary nature often limit their level of adoption.

Governments are implementing new unilateral due diligence regulations to discourage trade-induced deforestation.  Two  outstanding  examples  are  the  UK  Forest  Risk Commodities  Regime  (UKFRCR)  and  the  European  Union  Deforestation  Regulation (EUDR). The latter stands out because of its key leadership role in driving up standards globally (Bellfield et al. 2022). Commodities including soy, domestic cattle, palm oil,

wood, rubber, cocoa and coffee -as well as derived products like leather or chocolate- will have to be deforestation-free in order to access the EU market and require rigorous due diligence to demonstrate it.

Given the nonlinear nature of supply chains and the power and resource imbalances among different actors (Brooks et al. 2022), some stakeholders could be disproportionately  affected  by  the  EUDR.  Developing  Countries  (DCs)  and  Least Developed  Countries  (LDCs)  heavily  rely  on  these  commodities  for  export  (Arias Mahiques  et  al.  2024).  Beyond  the  national  level,  some  vulnerable  groups  such  as smallholder farmers, who produce roughly 35% of the world's food (Lowder et al. 2021), often lack the capacity to meet the new requirements. As argued by the leading producer countries of covered commodities in a joint letter to the WTO 1 , 'The EU's 'one-size-fitsall' approach [...] ignores different local conditions', imposing obstacles that stem from increased production costs due to complex compliance requirements.

These constraints can be explained in part by the commodity value chain. Agricultural commodities  undergo  multiple  intermediary  stages  in  the  supply  chain,  often  being bulked  and  mixed,  posing  intra-coordination  challenges  for  traceability  and  chain  of custody development (West 2021), which vary depending on the size of the chain and its level of integration (fully integrated from cradle to port or has multiple origins). Diversity in  information  management  systems  is  critical.  The  public  sector  has  a  challenge  as existing public information systems regarding health, fiscal, and environmental data lack articulation and are often subject to tax secrecy regulations. The timeliness of information required is also key to meet the requirements, yet gaps persist particularly in land tenure

<!-- image -->

and legal access rights, often due to commercial dynamics among producers, agents, and intermediaries (Frip et al. 2023).

The due diligence scheme also requires analysis software and an operating system capable of validating different layers of information (e.g. satellite, fiscal, public health). This  entails  capacity  building  programs  among  system  users,  mainly  in  primary producers. Small non-EU suppliers are at risk of being excluded from international value chains, not because they have engaged in deforestation, but because they face struggles demonstrating compliance with the strict regulations, in a context in which uncertainty still remains regarding who will cover the implementation costs (Cesar de Oliveira et al. 2024).

## The G20s role

As the premier forum for international cooperation, the G20 holds a unique position to drive coordinated action and hold accountability upon its members in order to reduce trade-induced deforestation. Its members represent around 85% of the world's GDP, over 75% of world trade, and around two-thirds of the world's population 2 .

In  terms  of  deforestation,  the  G20  (including  AU)  accounted  for  78%  of deforestation embedded in worldwide consumption in 2021 3 .  Figure 1 presents the distribution  of  this  deforestation,  distinguishing  between  three  types  of  origin:  'from domestic  production',  'from  overseas  production  within  G20'  and  'from  overseas production  outside  G20'.  This  significant  supply  chain  coverage  demonstrates  the potential impact the G20 can have in reducing trade-induced deforestation.

Furthermore,  Figure  2  reveals  that  rich  countries  tend  to  act  as  net  importers  of deforestation. The graph shows a negative correlation between GDP per capita and our calculated 'Deforestation-Embedded Trade Balance Index', where positive and negative index values indicate a country's role as a net exporter and importer of deforestation, respectively. This  highlights  the  need  for  the  G20  to  take  into  account  the  disparities between countries when addressing trade-induced deforestation.

## Recommendations

The new due diligence regulations aimed at discouraging overseas deforestation run the  risk  of  disproportionately  affecting  DCs  and  LDCs,  as  well  as  certain  vulnerable groups. Although G20 members contribute to deforestation through consumption, they can also be part of the solution through new patterns of production. To ensure sustainable,  fair  and  inclusive  growth,  G20  members  can  take  immediate  actions addressing three critical dimensions: (1) participatory governance, (2) capacity building, and (3) economic incentives.

Figure 3. Critical dimensions for G20's action

## (1) Participatory governance

The unilateral nature of new due diligence regulations has been challenged by third countries, which, despite being affected by them, lack clear or official means to influence the legal process behind the design of such measures. Furthermore, these regulations often operate in silos, addressing only a narrow set of sustainability dimensions across limited

<!-- image -->

jurisdictions  and  towards  short-term  goals.  Integrating  both  domestic  and  multilateral measures is essential for addressing sustainability issues in global trade.

Considering its  diverse  integration,  the  G20  is  uniquely  positioned  to  promote  the creation  of  a  more  inclusive  governance.  Its  members  can  strengthen  and  foster multilateral efforts to tackle climate change, deforestation, and biodiversity loss with a comprehensive  approach.  This  can  be  achieved  by setting guidelines  for  wider stakeholder participation during the design and implementation of these regulations.

Additionally, the G20 can promote greater harmonization and mutual recognition between  international  standards  and  national  legislations,  while  also  supporting  the development of local and regional anti-deforestation strategies in partnership with all stakeholders, including smallholder farmers, local communities and indigenous people, institutions,  CSOs,  and  businesses.  For  instance,  a  unified  deforestation  cut-off  date across standards would prevent redundant analysis of satellite imagery and algorithms.

In  this  context,  the  institutional  dimension  becomes  highly  relevant.  Effective governance of complex socio-economic and environmental systems requires polycentric institutions (Ostrom  2010),  consisting  of  multiple  decision-making  centers,  each formally independent but with the potential to function as a system (V. Ostrom et al. 1961).

For polycentric institutions ' vertical integration ' (across ecosystems and jurisdictions) and ' horizontal integration ' (across supply chain actors and stakeholders) are complementary and necessary tools to ensure that different policies, commitments, and initiatives  act  in  synergy,  producing  the  desired  results,  limiting  unsolicited  leakage effects, reducing risk and uncertainty, and increasing the level of trust among different stakeholders (De Maria et al. 2022).

## (2) Capacity building

There have been increasing concerns about the ability of DCs and LDCs to meet the complex data requirements outlined in the new due diligence regulations. Smallholder farmers, in particular, are at risk of being excluded from international value chains, not because they have engaged in deforestation, but due to their struggles in demonstrating compliance with the strict regulations. These groups urgently need access to financing schemes, new technologies, and technical assistance to overcome the administrative burden related to geolocation and traceability requirements, certifications, and customs procedures. Programs such as AL-INVEST supported by the EU are starting to show interesting results, such as Uruguay's implementation of a public geo-referencing system for its deforestation-free timber exports.

G20 members can play a vital role in bridging regulatory gaps by targeting investments in capacity building in DCs and LDcs. 4 Funding deployment should focus on solutions from blockchain, geospatial AI, RFID to software development. Strengthening linkages across existing systems, protocols, datasets, and certifications in both public and private sectors is crucial (Frip et al. 2023). Increasing funding for scaling up existing systems and  incorporating  additional  layers  of  information  such  as  land  use  change  into traceability schemes is essential. These investments need to be accompanied by technical training and assistance to transfer technical skills to local producers.

Transparency is a key enabling condition to make any traceability system operational, credible and robust. In the case of the EUDR, the upstream supply chain is essential in

4 For instance, this gap is evident in research and development (R&amp;D) expenditure: with high-income  countries  allocating  approximately  2.97%  of  GDP  compared  to  around 0.53% in lower-middle-income countries (UNCTAD 2023).

providing  information. The  system  requires  express  authorizations  for  data  use  at  the public level that allow information to be shared with public and private systems. The G20 could support cooperation initiatives among countries to harmonize the means by which that information is provided, taking into account the local characteristics of different suppliers . This alignment needs to consider data protection policies and tax secrecy to prevent these policies from hindering the consolidation of traceability systems.

## (3) Economic incentives

An important challenge posed by the new environmental regulations is to maintain the balance between sustainability and inclusion. The implementation of these regulations carries the risk of imposing high compliance costs, potentially resulting in producers or countries  losing  access  to  the  global  market,  with  a  higher  risk  of  exclusion  for smallholder producers. Importers might end up changing suppliers, abandoning commercial  relations  with  smallholder  farmers  while  favoring  larger  producers  better prepared to comply. Consequently, this can increase the risk of land conflicts between large-scale and small-scale agriculture (Zhunusova et al. 2022).

To mitigate these issues, it is imperative for G20 members to foster the development of markets and value chains that incentivize sustainable farming practices . Importers can offer price premiums for products adhering to sustainability standards, which could offset  compliance  costs  borne  by  producers. These  price  premiums  can  be  calculated using  objective  and  technical  measures  of  compliance  costs.  To  ensure  that  these economic incentives effectively reach smallholder farmers, the design of any instrument must take into account the characteristics of the value chains such as intermediaries and origins (e.g multiple origins).

## Scenario of outcomes

New trade regulations such as the EUDR and the UKFRCR can contribute to reducing deforestation and reverting climate change. However, these new instruments have been linked with a risk of exclusion for supply chain actors in producing regions, particularly smallholders,  family  farms,  and  small-scale  producers  in  DCs  and  LDCs.  A  more inclusive  governance  in  the  design  and  implementation  of  these  tools,  together  with tailored  capacity  building  efforts  and  clear  economic  incentives  are  needed  to  reduce these unintended consequences, while ensuring the creation of the information and data needed to meet social and environmental traceability requirements.

The effective implementation of these recommendations provides an opportunity for the  G20  to  address  the  key  role  it  could  play  in  outlining  policy  strategies  that comprehensively integrate deforestation, trade, and agrifood systems, and guarantee the  participation  of  DCs  and  LDCs,  in  order  to  achieve  SDGs  worldwide.  Regarding governance, as it was pointed out, international and regional commitments are many, but an articulated implementation is difficult due to the multiplicity of actors and interests to  be  addressed. To deliver comprehensive and inclusive solutions, the G20 efforts to foster participatory instances should take a solution-focused approach as well as endorse multilateral integrated actions ,  bridging  institutional  and  technical  silos  to  deliver  a consolidated response (UNEP 2024).

As  an  opportunity,  implementing  traceability  and  chain  of  custody  systems  with successive  layers  of  verified  information,  not  only  environmental  but  also  social  and fiscal,  allows  increasing  productive  efficiency,  making  triple  performance  visible  and achieving recognition through market access. However, due to the current heterogeneous landscape of standards and metrics, any initiative that promotes common guidelines

on traceability and transparency will require urgent work to ensure alignment across data  and  measurements across  these  scales ,  to  allow  the  effective  and  coordinated implementation  of  policy  and  practice  (Piñeiro  et  al.  2023).  There  is  also  a  major challenge  in  relation  to  the  accreditation  of  circumstances  that  do  not  rely  solely  on technology, such as verifying that production was carried out in compliance with legal frameworks (e.g. human rights standards).

Regarding  economic  incentives,  evidence  suggests  that  implementing  the  right positive incentives can effectively discourage deforestation in a cost-effective manner. Monetary incentives for forest preservation and reforestation, which are land-intensive and unskilled  labor-intensive  activities,  can  represent  a cost-effective  opportunity  in DCs  and  LDCs ,  where  associated  land  and  labor  costs  are  lower.  For  instance, Jayachandran  et  al.  (2017)  found  that  a  payment  for  ecosystem  services  program  in Uganda effectively reduced deforestation by 50%, leading to CO2 emissions reductions at a fraction of the cost compared to similar programs in the US.

By  fostering  collaboration  and  inclusivity  across  regional,  national, and  local governance spheres, the G20 can play a key role in outlining policies tailored to the local conditions of producing countries, ensuring that the benefits of economic growth and environmental  initiatives  are  equitably  distributed  across  society  and  that  vulnerable populations are not disproportionately impacted. Ultimately, any strategy implemented to address the outlined scenarios is based on considering the SDGs principle to leave no one behind.

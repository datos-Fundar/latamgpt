## T20 Policy Brief

## Abstract

In 2024, debtor countries will pay the International Monetary Fund (IMF) an effective annual interest rate of up to 8 basis points. The current lending rate policy is procyclical, it amplifies the global spill-over of monetary policy and makes it harder for IMF programs to promote economic recoveries. We recommend setting a cap on the lending rate and/or devising a surcharge-sliding scale.

## The Challenge

The IMF's current lending policy is not fit for purpose, within excessively high and pro-cyclical policy rates that contradict the objectives of the Fund.

The exact policy rates that borrowers pay depend on several factors. The IMF has several lending facilities. For non-concessional lending from the IMF's General Resource Account (GRA), the institution charges a lending rate. The IMF lending rate is composed of a basic rate and (if they apply) surcharges. The basic rate is composed of a fixed margin (currently at 100 basis points) over the interest rate on the IMF's quasi-currency -Special Drawing  Rights  (SDRs)-  plus  the  service  (50  basis  points  per  disbursement)  and commitment fee (15-60  basis  points,  refundable  when  disbursed). The  SDR  rate  is  a weighted average of the interest rates of the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, China, and the Eurozone (Box 1).

For  countries  that  tap  resources  from  the  General  Resources  Account,  the  IMF nowadays  imposes  (see  IMF,  2016a)  200  basis  points  to  the  portion  of  the  credit outstanding greater than 187.5 percent of the quota and 100 basis points on the portion of credit exceeding the threshold of 187.5 percent of quota for more than 36 months (51 months under the Extended Fund Facility).

BOX 1. SDR rate Calculation

The SDR rate ( ùëÜùê∑ùëÖùëñ ) is calculated as follows:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Where ùê¥ùëñ , ùêµùëñ , and ùê∂ùëñ are the currency amount in the calculation basket, the exchange rate against the SDR, and the three month interest rate on treasury bills/bonds, for the i-th country. Currently, the SDR basket is composed of five currencies (the US Dollar, the British Pound, the Japanese Yen, the Chinese Yuan, and the European Euro).

The  current  lending  rate  policy  is  procyclical.  Total  IMF  GRA  credit  outstanding increased from 73.5 billion SDR at the end of 2019 to 112.8 billion SDR at the end of February of 2024 - a record high. This rise in costs of borrowing costs alongside IMF lending is unprecedented in the Fund's history (Figure 1). Expansions of IMF lending have  historically  coincided  with  a  falling  SDR  rate,  given  that  economic  downturns caused many countries to resort to the Fund alongside reductions in monetary policy rates of major central banks (Krahnke and Tordoir, 2023). Today, the IMF's lending activities are procyclical for the first time.

This  procyclicality  may  worsen  further  if  central  banks  keep  rates  high  or  even increase them. According to the IMF's estimates, the demand for its assistance is set to increase  further,  reflecting  the  impact  of  Russia's  invasion  of  Ukraine  and  inflation developments (Krahnke and Tordoir, 2023). For the first time this century, half of the world's 75 poorest countries are seeing an increasing income disparity with the wealthiest economies, marking a historical reversal in development progress (World Bank 2024).

The high lending rate also has knock-on effects for these countries who do not borrow from the GRA, but from the Fund's concessional windows, like the Poverty Reduction and  Growth  Trust  (PRGT),  which  low-income  countries  can  tap  for  lending  at  a subsidized rate of zero percent. As the SDR rate increases, more funds are needed to subsidize  these  loans,  straining  PRGT  finances. The  higher  SDR  rate  also  affects  the

<!-- image -->

newly established Resilience and Sustainability Trust (RST), which assists countries with climate change challenges (Krahnke and Tordoir, 2023).

The  recent  increase  in  the  SDR  rate  has  prompted  the  IMF  Executive  Board  to implement  a  225  basis  points  cap  for  the  lowest-income  RST-eligible  members. Additionally, many low-income countries drew on their SDR allocations in 2021 when interest rates were still low. These countries do not have to replenish their holdings, but they must pay the SDR rate on the amount drawn. This has now turned into expensive credit, especially for poor countries who made active use of the 2021 allocation and are in need for highly concessional financing or grants.

## Surcharges increase procyclicality

Surcharges were established to mitigate credit risk by limiting the demand for IMF assistance and encouraging early repayment. Surcharges allow the IMF to build its own reserves, given that the fixed margin of 100 basis points already covers most of the IMF's operational costs. The balance of payments needs of countries in distress are so large that several have borrowed large amounts for long periods, increasing their borrowing costs to 800 basis points per year 1 .

1 Today, out of 33 countries paying charges for Stand-By Arrangements and Extended Fund Facilities 22 are paying surcharges (Angola, Argentina, Armenia, Barbados, Benin, Costa Rica, C√¥te d'Ivoire, Ecuador, Egypt, Gabon, Georgia, Jordan, Kenya, Moldova, Mongolia,  North  Macedonia,  Pakistan,  Senegal,  Seychelles,  Sri  Lanka,  Tunisia,  and Ukraine).  The  total  number  of  active  Stand-By  Arrangements  and  Extended  Fund Facilities is 25, but some countries such are still paying charges and surcharges (as they have a credit outstanding).

<!-- image -->

The latest IMF policy paper on this issue states that the current surcharge policy allows the institution to accumulate precautionary balances, provides members with incentives to limit their demand for IMF assistance, and encourages early repayment (IMF, 2016b). While the  IMF's  income  model  explicitly  requires  the  accumulation  of  precautionary balances, it is unclear why these should come from surcharges. Countries that request assistance from the IMF for the balance of payment needs may not have access to other sources of affordable financing (and may not be able to afford early repayment).

## The current lending rate amplifies global spill-overs of monetary policy

High SDR rates reflect advanced economic decisions on monetary policy, which are made solely with an eye to fighting inflation in their domestic jurisdiction. As is well documented (Degasperi et. al., 2023; Mishra and Rajan, 2016), these policy rates are often inappropriate for macroeconomic conditions in other jurisdictions. Financial crises are also  often  triggered  by  changes  in  the  financial  conditions  in  the  US  (Rey,  2015). Countries  that  face  worse  financial  conditions  need  to  resort  to  the  IMF  to  remove financial  constraints  while  they  regain  market  access.  However,  this  is  more  difficult because the lending rate increases due to the monetary policy of the advanced economies (which affects the SDR rate).

Today, monetary policy rates are going up just when many countries struggle with high levels of debt and need support. Global public debt has reached a total of US$92 trillion, of which almost 30% is owed by developing countries. The proportion of poor countries in debt distress, or at high risk of debt distress, has more than doubled to almost 60 percent from a decade ago. Half of developing countries spend more than 1.5% of their GDP and 6.9% of their government revenues on interest payments, while 19 countries are spending

<!-- image -->

more on interest than on education and 45 more on interest than on health (UNCTAD, 2023).

Borrowers are doubly penalized due to the existence of surcharges. Those that need support  from  the  IMF  must  face  more  restrictive  credit  conditions  and  are  typically affected by tighter financial constraints, for instance by climate-related natural disasters or military conflict (e.g. Ukraine). The current lending policy thus amplifies the spill-over effects  of  monetary  policy  and  reinforces  countries'  funding  difficulties  (Stiglitz  and Gallagher, 2022).

High  lending  rates  will  make  it  harder  for  IMF  programs  to  promote  economic recoveries.  In  2011,  the  IMF  proposed  a  new  model  to move away from relying on lending  income  as  the  primary  source  of  revenue  to  minimize  the  institution's exposure and sustain a steadier flow of income during times of low lending activity .

This new income model also sought to ensure the institution accumulated enough reserves (IMF, 2011). Despite these changes, lending income represents about 95% of the income for the projections for the fiscal year 2023 and about 71% for the fiscal year 2024 (Table

1).

For debtor countries, the burden of repaying high interest rates to the IMF itself takes away much-needed cash, possibly deepening their budgetary woes and hampering their prospects of economic recovery. The high SDR rate may undermine the catalytic role of the  fund  in  'crowding-in  private  finance. The  more  expensive  it  gets  for  countries  to service their debt from the IMF - the senior creditor - the less faith private investors will have in also being repaid.

## Recommendations for the G20

There is a need for G20 countries -as the major shareholders of the IMF- to take action and explore options to reform the institution's lending practices. As the main shareholder of the IMF, the G20 has the soft power and voting share to promote a discussion on the lending policy.

The decision to alter the IMF lending rate is not without precedent. For instance, the basic rate was historically adjusted to reflect the Fund's operative costs, but during FY07 this would have implied a basic rate of 350 basis points (due to the reduction in the amount of credit outstanding), and this level was deemed 'too high' (IMF, 2016c, page 10). In response, an exceptional circumstances clause was added to allow the margin for the rate of charge to be set on a basis other than estimated income and expenses. The Executive Board discussed and modified the lending practices in 2014, when they established a floor of 5 basis points in the context of low international interest rates.

Because the reduction of basic rate -currently 100 basis points- is not enough, a partial solution is to put a cap on the SDR rate to reduce the lending rate . This could be complemented  with a  surcharge-sliding  scale ,  which  means  that  the  surcharge  rate should increase when the SDR rate decreases and vice versa. The Executive Board can change the surcharge policy without changing the IMF Articles.

Considering its feasibility and its positive effects both on the IMF and the borrowing economies, we propose to the G20 to set the cap at reasonable level, for instance, 500 basis points. This could be achieved either by establishing a limit on the lending rates or by introducing a surcharge-sliding scale (so the surcharge component falls when the SDR rate increases, and vice versa).

<!-- image -->

No one profits from countries facing debt overhangs, neither debtor countries, nor their creditors. However, attention must be given to potential losers of any changes made. The lending  rate  reform  can  either  more  heavily  impact  the  Fund's  operative  income  by 'taking some fat off the IMF's bones', or the IMF's net creditors by asking them to cover the costs.

## Scenario of outcomes

The IMF estimates that rates will remain high for at least two years (IMF, 2023b). To avoid this, we propose the adoption of a cap on lending rates at 500 basis points. We expect this policy to have a substantial impact on borrowing countries. Countries that are currently paying surcharges will face a reduction of 300 basis points from current levels. This  policy  will  affect  the  IMF  finances,  but  the  institution  already  holds  substantial precautionary balances (Table 1), and there is no reason to expect a shortfall of incomes with rates that are at most 500 basis points per year.

Consider Argentina, Egypt, Ukraine, Ecuador, and Pakistan, which together account for about 57% of the total GRA credit outstanding (Table 2). Assuming a lending rate of 800 basis points, they will pay around 5.1 billion SDR annually. Capping lending rates at 500 basis points will imply cutting payments from those countries by about 2 billion SDRs per year. Borrowing from the IMF represents a significant share of total external indebtedness, and charges are about one-third to one-fifth of the total spending on health (Table 3).

*Assuming an SDR to dollar exchange rate of 1,3 and a basic rate of 500 basis points plus surcharges.

There are three ways in which the IMF can deal with lower income. One would be for the IMF to run down (or to slow down the rate of accumulation of) the precautionary balances. The second would be a cap on the SDR rate to reduce the remuneration that flows from net debtors to net creditors inside the GRA. The third option would be to

<!-- image -->

increase  surcharges  in  a  low-interest  rate  environment.  This  would  mean  the  Fund's income goes down when monetary policy is restrictive but goes up relative to where it would be if monetary policy is accommodative. A plausible proposal could combine these three elements.

These options also  have  implications  for  the  IMF's Trust  funds. An  SDR  rate  cap would reduce the need for pledging subsidies to the PRGT and RST. A lower SDR rate (at  which  the  Trust  Fund's  creditors  get  remunerated)  lowers  the  needed  funds  to subsidize the PRGT's zero percent loans, reducing pressure on PRGT finances -which are already under strain owing to substantially stronger demand for PRGT loans-. For the RST,  an  SDR  rate  cap  would  reduce  lending  rates,  but  increase  the  pace  of  reserve accumulation. This  is  because  the  contributors  of  the  RST  deposit  account  -which  is meant  to  generate  investment  income  for  the  trust-  are  remunerated  at  the  SDR  rate. Hence, an SDR rate cap would immediately increase the 'profit margin' of the deposit account.  Finally,  an  SDR  rate  cap  would  directly  reduce  the  interest  rate  burden  for countries that tapped their 2021 SDR allocation. Reducing surcharges instead would leave the  PRGT's  subsidy  needs,  the  RST's  reserves  accumulation,  and  the  cost  of  SDR drawings unchanged.

There is an ongoing discussion concerning the rechanneling of SDRs via Multilateral Development Banks, where some central banks have emphasized the importance of the SDRs retaining their reserve asset characteristics. The proposed changes do not impact the status of the SDRs held by the members. One concern with capping the SDR rate versus adjusting surcharges is that it could negatively impact the tradability of SDRs. SDRs  can  exclusively  be  exchanged  for  freely  usable  currencies  in  transactions  by agreement, primarily through the Voluntary Trading Arrangements (VTAs). Transactions rely on countries' goodwill to exchange, say, US dollar reserves against SDRs. A lower

<!-- image -->

SDR remuneration could, therefore, discourage them from making such a trade. However, SDR holdings are small relative to overall foreign exchange reserves. A decision to cap the SDR rate temporarily would be made by the member countries of the IMF, which could  commit  to  continue  undertaking  any  SDR  transactions  despite  a  slightly  lower return  on  potential  positive  net  SDR  holdings. An  SDR  rate  cap  could,  therefore,  be accompanied by a VTA reform in which major creditor countries commit to maintaining VTA liquidity. Lowering surcharges would not negatively impact VTA liquidity.

## Abstract

In recent years, several G20 countries have faced significant political unrest fueled by electoral misinformation, a dangerous mix of political polarization and the amplification of  false  claims  about  electoral  integrity  via  media  and  social  media.  These  events underscore the urgent need to combat misinformation and restore public trust in both democratic processes, and the technologies used during an election.  This policy brief explores the challenges surrounding the digitization of electoral processes and proposes innovative  approaches  to  solving  them  through  cooperation,  openness,  and  synergies from all sectors, emphasizing shared standards and community involvement. It builds upon the G20 New Delhi Leaders' Declaration commitment to improving access to digital services and digital public infrastructure. The brief is informed by a concrete example through a case study of Argentina, illustrating the difficulties and opportunities at the intersection of elections, data, and digitization. As Brazil, during its G20 presidency, aims to elevate democracy as a cornerstone for addressing global challenges, the brief stresses the opportunity for G20 countries to increase public confidence in electoral processes by adopting a digital public infrastructure stack to enhance electoral integrity globally. This includes developing secure, interoperable systems built on open standards, which can be adapted  across jurisdictions,  and  maintained  and  improved  through  international cooperation, taking into consideration a trusted, rights-based, people-centric digitization of the electoral processes.

## Diagnosis of the Issue

## Understanding a global problem

In recent years, political unrest fueled by electoral misinformation has emerged as a critical  challenge  in  several  G20  countries,  notably  in  the  United  States,  Brazil,  and Argentina. The U.S. Capitol riots in 2021 1 , Brazil's Congress attack in 2022 2 , and claims of electoral fraud in Argentina's 2023 elections 3 share a common thread: the dangerous

1 The United States Capitol riots on January 6, 2021, were the culmination of a highly contentious 2020's presidential election, exacerbated by deep political polarization and fueled by former President Trump's persistent false claims of voter fraud. Trump's rhetoric at a rally preceding the riots urged his supporters to "fight like hell," contributing to the violent  atmosphere.  Social  media  platforms  played  a  significant  role  in  spreading misinformation and organizing the rally.

2 During 2022 Brazil's close presidential election between Jair Bolsonaro and Luiz Inácio Lula  da  Silva,  misinformation  about  the  integrity  of  the  electronic  voting  system permeated public discourse. Bolsonaro's defeat triggered an escalation of tensions fueled by false accusations of electoral fraud. The rioters who stormed Brazil's Congress on January  8,  one  week  after  Lula  da  Silva's  inauguration,  were  mobilized  in  part  by misinformation suggesting irregularities and fraud in the ballot box.

3 During Argentina's 2023 electoral cycle, a disinformation campaign emerged on social media and in some of the main media outlets to sow the idea that an electoral fraud took place in the voting on October 22. This campaign arose after the appearance of some inconsistencies between the provisional scrutiny telegrams and the value loaded into the provisional vote counting system.

mix of political polarization and the role of media outlets and social media in amplifying false claims about election integrity. Many claims questioned the technology used by the electoral authorities and the vendors hired to provide critical components of the electoral process.

These incidents underscore the urgent need for measures to combat misinformation and restore public trust  in  democratic  processes 4 .  They  also  highlight  the  role  Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) could play in addressing misinformation and the uncertainties around an electoral process at its intersection with digital technologies (Daad and Khan, 2023).  In  the  following  section  of  this  policy  brief,  we  discuss  how  to  apply  those measures using a successful experience in a Latin American country, Argentina, as an example. The case highlights the importance of the public's understanding and trust of the technical and data layer, elections rely upon.

4 A recent study by LAPOP Lab shows among other findings that: (a) Less than half of the population trusts elections in most Latin American and Caribbean countries and (b) Satisfaction  with  democracy  is  positively  associated  with  the  perception  of  electoral integrity  (Stanic,  2023).    Similarly,  a  Brookings  study  of  some  recent  public  opinion surveys shows a deep erosion of confidence in democracy in the United States. And, it argues,  this  is  largely  a  consequence  of  the  spread  of  fake  news  and  disinformation campaigns during electoral processes (Sanchez &amp; Middlemass, 2022).

## Standardising electoral data to combat misinformation in elections

Argentina's National Electoral Directorate (DINE) is a technical body specializing in electoral administration. Its responsibility is to implement essential tools to guarantee the electoral process's transparency, security and reliability, thus ensuring the full exercise of political rights and the stability of democracy.  One of the fundamental aspects of its work is publishing the provisional results of the national elections. These have no legal validity in determining the elected representatives, but they serve an informative purpose for the citizens.

In 2021, the DINE set out to publish historical data related to provisional national election results in a standardized manner. Until then, this data was in various formats, making  it  difficult  to  use  quickly  and  programmatically  and  not  publicly  accessible. Ahead of the 2023 electoral process, the DINE launched different tools to facilitate access to these data through various media: an interactive dashboard (to consult the historical data  sets  already  standardized),  with  the  possibility  of  exporting  queries;  an API  for programmatic  data  consultation;  and  the  complete  disaggregated  data  (through  the national open data portal).

The October 2023 general election results were published with this strategy, 48 hours after  polls  closed,  and  only  a  few  hours  in  the  November  presidential  2nd  round (ballotage).

Thanks to these actions, Argentine civil society and media outlets had access to quality data to debunk social media assumptions and neutralize misinformation. This is not an isolated  case,  as  several  countries  adopt  technologies  and  techniques  to  make  their electoral processes open, transparent, participatory, and sustainable.

## Beyond data standards, a pledge for trusted, open and sustainable digital public infrastructure for electoral processes.

As the Argentinian case illustrates, Democracy and Electoral Integrity can be enhanced with a  combination of open, standardised data  and open tools to action  it. Brazil has pledged  to  use  its  presidency  of  the  G20  to  elevate  democracy  as  a  cornerstone  for addressing a range of global challenges, including inequality, poverty, hunger, climate change  and  the  transition  to  sustainable  energy  sources.  This  pledge  coincides  with President Da Silva's reflections on the January 8, 2023 coup attempt, as reported by the Washington Post. President Da Silva interpreted this incident as the pinnacle of a long campaign by extremist political leaders to undermine democracy for their own benefit. Criticizing Brazil's electoral system - despite its international acclaim for its integrity these  figures  mirrored  the  tactics  of  U.S.  electoral  sceptics  by  casting  unfounded calumnies  on  Brazil's  electoral  process  to  delegitimize  democracy  to  cling  to  power autocratically. This stance highlights Brazil's broader objective during its tenure at the G20: to strengthen democratic principles for addressing and resolving pressing global issues.  The  2012  Report  of  the  Global  Commission  on  Elections,  Democracy,  and Security  highlighted  that  'Integrity  depends  on  public  confidence  in  electoral  and political processes. It is not enough to reform institutions; citizens must be convinced that the changes are real and deserve their trust. Inclusion, transparency and accountability are key to developing that trust. Without transparency, citizens cannot know that elections are genuine' (Annan, 2012).

Although  the  concept  of  electoral  process  integrity,  applies  to  a  broad  set  of situations-such as voter registration, electoral campaigns, election administration, and vote  counting,  among  others,  here,  we  focus  on  a  concrete  example  to  illustrate  how

advancing projects to improve Digital Public Infrastructures can result in improvements in electoral governance.

Electoral  integrity  encompasses  the  idea  that  elections  must  meet  predetermined criteria  to  be  recognized  as  democratic.  In  this  sense,  an  essential  aspect  of  electoral governance  lies  in  managing  technical  and  administrative  resources  to  promote  the legitimacy of the democratic act. By facilitating access to data and the transparency of the  process  that  generates  it,  the  space  for  the  political  misuse  of  information  amid electoral  competition  is  limited  but  data  alone  cannot  deliver  the  electoral  integrity needed. Increasingly, governments are relying on technology to mediate each stage of the electoral process and recent initiatives by G20, present in the leaders' declaration of 2023 provide the space to consider a collaborative approach to address shared challenges of the digital  dimension  of  elections:  Digital  Public  Infrastructure  to  enhance  election  trust, security and accessibility, committing to collaborate and work together to provide key technical tools to enhance electoral systems everywhere.

## Recommendations

As the idea of Digital Public Infrastructure takes off and countries all over the World are signing MOUs to cooperate in sharing systems to address common challenges, such as payments or IDs, this brief proposes that the leaders focus on the electoral process for their  future  investments  in  digital  public  infrastructure  for  the  reasons  detailed  above. This could considerably impact if done right, the democratic infrastructure and reliability of  elections  in  more  than  one  jurisdiction  would  have  a  considerable  impact  whilst establishing a robust accountability mechanism for the systems that run elections 5 . This

5 The discussion about the use of technology in electoral processes is not new (Aldana, 2010). However, the incorporation of technology in electoral processes should not occur indiscriminately or at all stages. For example, the concern about the lack of transparency associated with introducing technology into the electoral process, particularly when it comes to the technology used for casting votes, has led several countries, such as Ireland, the Netherlands, and Germany, to reverse their implementation of electronic voting. The main arguments cited by those who warn against it are the lack of guarantees provided by these new technologies and the potential risks they pose to the security and integrity of elections. For a brief overview of this literature, see Ruiz Nicolini (2019). The call to develop digital public infrastructure for electoral processes must take into account certain risks  associated  with  the  use  of  technology  in  democratic  elections.  Beyond  these examples, we believe that  the  connection  between  the  different  instances  of  electoral processes and the development of Public Digital Infrastructures has not been extensively discussed and could result in better democracies, less conflict, and greater legitimization of the processes.

could be done with shared digital systems that are secure, interoperable, and built upon open standards, code, and specifications, resulting in a model DPI for Elections, which would include all the digital blocks that any electoral process needs. The current DPI initiatives should be used to better understand, develop, and share the technologies that democracy needs.

By addressing several key challenges and opportunities at the intersection of elections, data, and digitization, we argue that Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) can significantly enhance electoral processes in at least five aspects:

## a. Transparency.

As per the Argentinian example shared above, adopting open standards for electoral data and making it accessible through an API, this allows multiple actors to verify election results  independently,  debunking  disinformation  and  providing  accurate  data  to  the public. The openness and data standarisation could extend to each stage of the process, from registration to geodata on the voting centers and historical data and metadata of past elections.

## b. Security and Integrity.

With the adoption of the DPI Safeguards, the  DPI approach for the technology  to conduct elections can enhance the security and integrity of elections. By using secure, interoperable systems built on open standards, electoral authorities can prevent fraud and enhance the reliability of election outcomes.

## c. Standardization and Best Practices.

Enhancing  G20  technical  cooperation.    Electoral  DPIs  can  ensure  consistency  and reliability across different electoral systems while offering an open-by-design approach that would enable localzisation. The G20 members could then concentrate efforts in the development of a model DPI for elections that are secure, interoperable, and adaptable to various jurisdictions. This can set a global benchmark for electoral processes, enhancing their credibility and reliability.

Through the process of studying the viability of DPIs to secure a free and fair election, the G20 leaders should include the technical community, Civil Society Organizations, digital activists, journalists and electoral watchdogs to provide feedback and share their experiences in monitoring the digital aspects of an election. With such commitment to openness  and  participation,  electoral  authorities  will  enjoy  further  credibility  and  an international endorsement when they succeed. A collaborative space in electoral matters will increase government and citizens' accountability and trust.

As the Argentinian example shows, different electoral authorities have found formulas, coded software, and established good practices to overcome the electoral process and technology difficulties, while many others are still unaware of the complexities of the digital  dimension  of  their  electoral  processes  (Avila,  2018).      Every  electoral  year,  in several  countries,  considerable  investment  goes  to  private  providers  to  support  the national government in conducting the digital aspects of an election.  Depending on the country, relying on a private actor to run the election triggers different problems, from vendor lock-ins to questioning the vendors' impartiality and integrity.

With targeted investment and coordination by the G20 members, a mechanism could be established to fund and support the general tools, standards and policies that form electoral DPI. Furthermore, the fund could assist in creating a community of practice

around the tools to keep the technical projects accountable and well-audited, as well as secure, bringing to the open source community the much-needed support for the critical digital infrastructures it handles (Sharma, 2023).

## The Road Ahead

For  a  resilient  effort  towards  Electoral  Public  Digital  Infrastructure,  with  the recommended focus on Electoral DPIs, countries of the G20 could start a multilayered approach to reduce the frictions of digital technologies and data in elections, including but  not  limited  to,  the  disinformation  aspects  of  it,  resulting  in  shared  software, procurement methods, data standards, best practices, policies and open source technical solutions that could adapt to the needs to each electoral system and make it more secure and accountable.   By designing, prototyping, deploying, and scaling solutions relying on a trusted digital public infrastructure for elections in a coordinated manner, G20 countries could  increase  their  credibility  vis-a-vis  citizens  and  be  assisted  by  a  democratic community of practice, with measurable public benefit (Eaves et al. 2024).

While the task is complex, the G20 countries and allies could deliver concrete and immediate results for the subsequent electoral cycles by establishing a working group tackling the difficulties at the intersection of digital technologies and electoral processes. The public benefit of an Electoral DPI could be transformative and pave the way for a different digitalization of electoral systems in most of the World.

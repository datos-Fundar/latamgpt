## Abstract

Many emerging markets and developing economies are burdened with high debt stocks and  lack  the fiscal space  to meet  their climate,  biodiversity,  and  sustainable development goals (SDGs) .  Most of these countries are rich in natural resources and biodiversity hotspots that function as global public goods. One potential solution is to mainstream SDGs debt swaps. A creditor allows debt relief and the debtor commits part of the savings toward investments in achieving climate, nature and other SDGs goals, while also improving their fiscal position.

Based on experience from the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative, SDGs debt swaps could mobilize over US$105 billion from debt negotiation and US$329 billion from new debt issuances. To date, implementation has been limited and hindered by high transaction costs, institutional challenges, and lack of transparency. The few swaps that have  taken  place  have  been  small  in  comparison  with  the  total  need  across  highlyindebted countries and were all in upper-middle or high-income countries where the debt involved was privately held and was bought back via auctions. For low and lower-middleincome countries whose main creditors are bilateral and multilateral, that approach is less feasible and complex, costly and asymmetric negotiation processes will be needed, which may limit the scalability of these swaps.

The  G20  has  an  opportunity  to  call  for  enhancing  current  efforts  to  address  debt through a complementary Common Framework that integrates the broader concept of SDGs debt swaps, establishes guidelines, and supports their implementation to facilitate and promote fair negotiations.

## Diagnosis of the Issue

Although emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs) have contributed the least to climate change, they suffer the most from its effects, given their greater exposure to  extreme  weather  events  and  the  lack  of  infrastructure  and  fiscal  space  to  fund adaptation (Georgieva et al., 2022a). In addition, biodiversity, and its ability to provide key environmental services is decreasing at an unprecedented scale and pace (IPBES, 2019). Many EMDEs are rich in natural resources and biodiversity hotspots that-given their capacity to capture greenhouse gasses and regulate water cycles-function as global public goods. There is a global commitment to address climate change and support the conservation and restoration of such regions as captured in several conventions, including the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the United Nations  Convention  on  Biological  Diversity  (UNCBD),  and  the  United  Nations Convention  to  Combat  Desertification  (UNCCD).  However,  compliance  with  these commitments is not on track. The target to channel $100 billion per year in climate finance from  developed  to  EMDEs  has  still  not  been  met  and  huge  financing  gaps  exist  in supporting countries to achieve climate and biodiversity targets.

In addition, many EMDEs have high debt stocks and are at a high risk of fiscal distress (Georgieva  et  al.,  2022b),  which  is  preventing  them  from  investing  in  their  climate, biodiversity,  and  sustainable  development  goals  (SDGs). A  large  share  of  revenues  in many EMDEs is going toward debt servicing, which has risen substantially in the last couple of years with surging global interest rates. Sixty percent of low-income countries are currently at risk of debt distress (World Bank, 2023). This context calls for coordinated international action toward innovative and sustainable debt management arrangements.

One potential solution to help address fiscal problems and climate, biodiversity, and other SDGs simultaneously is to mainstream SDGs debt swaps. In these transactions, a creditor(s) provides debt relief 1 and  the  debtor  sovereign  commits part of the savings toward investments in achieving climate and nature goals, which can be expanded to include all SDGs (Steele and Patel, 2020; Jain et al., 2023; Pérez-Beltrán and Landry, 2023). When properly designed in alignment with national policies and commitments and in  a  proper  macroeconomic  context,  they  can  provide  greater  fiscal  space  to  reduce poverty and enhance economic growth (Steele et al., 2021).

To  date,  implementation  of  these  swaps  has  been  limited  and  hindered  by  high transaction costs, institutional challenges, and a lack of transparency (Jain et al., 2023). Recent  swaps  were  externally  driven,  without  adequate  involvement  of  affected communities,  and  their  scale  falls  short  of  addressing  the  needs  of  highly-indebted countries (Kelly et al., 2023). Moreover, those swaps involved upper-middle-income or high-income countries (Seychelles, Belize, Barbados, Ecuador, and Gabon). In the latter three cases, the debt was privately held and was repurchased through auctions, allowing the  sovereign  to  realize  savings  when  bonds  were  trading  at  a  discount  and  avoiding complex negotiation processes (Pérez-Beltrán and Landry, 2023; Jain et al., 2023, see Table A1 in the appendix for a summary of recent swaps). However, for EMDEs that lack access to capital markets and whose main creditors are bilateral (official and Paris Club) and multilateral, a new generation of swaps may be needed that involve complex, costly, and asymmetric negotiation processes, limiting their scalability.

1 This could be either by conversion to local currency and/or paid at a lower interest rate, some form of debt write-off, or by supporting conversion to a different financial vehicle.

An international platform to facilitate these swaps is needed. A relevant precedent is the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative (HIPC), established in 1996 to address EMDEs' debt and poverty challenges. HIPC demonstrated that debt reduction on a large scale is feasible with sufficient political will, and based on that experience, SDGs debt swaps  could  mobilize  more  than  US$105  billion  from  debt  negotiation  and  US$329 billion from new debt issuances (Patel, 2022).

Such  a  facilitating  platform  could  leverage  the  Common  Framework  for  Debt Treatments (CFDT), designed to cooperate on debt treatments for low-income countries eligible for the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) during the pandemic. It made a notable contribution by bringing China, the largest official creditor for many EMDEs (The Economist, 2020), into these debt negotiation processes (Ahmed and Brown, 2022). However,  only  four  countries  have  requested  debt  relief  under  the  CFDT  and  have experienced significant delays and difficulties (Georgieva and Pazarbasioglu, 2021).

## Recommendations

Recent proposals to the T20 called for initiatives to free up resources in EMDEs to invest in resilience and a just transition (Akhtar et al., 2022; Narula et al., 2023; Canuto et al., 2023; Nair et al., 2024; Chakrabarty et al., 2024). In addition, UNESCWA (2020) proposes a new generation of (bilateral) debt swaps. Building on these, we recommend that the G20 finance ministers formulate an action plan for developing a complementary

Common Framework for SDGs debt swaps (CFSDDS), which sets out key principles that  guide a G20 response to drive action globally. The CFSDDS would integrate the broader concept of SDGs  debt swaps, establish guidelines, and support their implementation.

Historically,  debt-for-climate  swaps  were  aimed  at  climate  action  while  debt-fornature swaps targeted preserving and restoring biodiversity. Given that climate action and biodiversity preservation are among the 17 SDGs, it is reasonable to formally integrate them under the broad umbrella of SDGs debt swaps to allow for these instruments to be used to meet other sustainability goals.

To  ensure  this  alignment  and  effective  transactions,  a  programmatic  approach  that takes a broader perspective on the swap, shifts support from projects to programs, and prioritizes transparency is key (see Figure 1). Following this overarching principle, the CFSDDS  could  enable  a  conducive  environment  for  fair  transactions  and  guide  its implementation through the following: define eligibility criteria, standardize to reduce transaction costs and promote fair negotiations, and provide technical assistance to align Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) with national and global goals.

Within this integral concept of swaps, it is necessary to differentiate those dealing with debt with private creditors from those with official creditors. In the former, the use of

<!-- image -->

auctions to buy back debt and the standardization of much of the swap, including the design of the new bonds and KPIs and the de-risking mechanisms, can considerably ease and accelerate the process. This is the likely scenario for some middle-income countries seeking to attract private investors. In the second case, which is the typical scenario for low and some lower-middle-income countries, the debt involved is in the form of loans, which may require complex negotiations and greater flexibility in determining KPIs, and the possibility of standardization is reduced to certain initial parameters.

Our policy recommendations are detailed below:

## Define eligibility criteria

Debt  swaps  are  not  a  universally  viable  solution  and  their  effectiveness  varies depending on, among many factors, country context. Swaps are a tool for countries that are heading towards debt distress or liquidity problems or have high debt burdens that hold the potential for investing in SDGs. For countries with unsustainable debt dynamics,

<!-- image -->

grants,  and  comprehensive  debt  restructuring  through  mechanisms  such  as  the  CFDT should come first (Chamon et al., 2022). The eligibility should be larger than that of the CFDT, extending to all countries at risk of debt distress. Support could be prioritized based on climate and biodiversity vulnerability, poverty, indebtedness, and readiness of financing systems (Steele and Patel, 2020).

## Standardize to reduce transaction costs and promote fair negotiations

Despite variations in country contexts, a set of features can be standardized. This will promote fair negotiations, enhance its scalability by streamlining the process of reaching a deal, and add to the liquidity of the bond when issued as part of the transaction.

The CFSDDS should elaborate a standardization of the general parameters of debt swaps to facilitate their negotiations. A relevant precedent is the Paris Club's DSSI framework,  which  ensures  that  all  creditors  are  on  the  same  page  and  supports  the legitimacy  of  the  process  (Paris  Club,  n.d.).  A  memorandum  of  understanding  was produced outlining how the broad parameters of the DSSI could be translated into revised lending agreements. This reduces the amount of bilateral back-and-forth needed to agree on  the  general  aspects  of  debt  suspension  before  addressing  the  country-specific conditions, and can also be used by non-Paris Club creditors to come in to support debt suspension based on the same terms. Several initiatives that could serve this purpose are emerging,  such  as  the  Sustainable  Debt  Coalition  and  the  V20 Accra  to  Marrakech Agenda.

A  common problem  with  both  official  and  private  debt  swaps  is  that  some  rating agencies may view the swap as a default event. Proactive debt management aimed at improving debt and economic stability should not be perceived in the same way as debt restructurings and defaults in times of crisis. The CFSDDS should promote an update on

<!-- image -->

how rating agencies address these issues considering the net benefit to the sovereign's fiscal outlook along with providing for the common good of meeting SDGs.

A  critical  feature  of  debt  swaps  seeking  to  engage  private  finance  is  the  credit enhancement provided by a third party as it helps determine investor demand for the bond and the fiscal  savings  that  can  be  achieved.  Currently,  each  guarantee  is  tailored  to  a particular  swap  and  may  vary  considerably,  which  requires  investors  to  peruse  the prospectus  of  the  new  bond  carefully  to  assess  its  specifics  (Jain  et  al.,  2023). Standardizing this could reduce uncertainty and increase demand for the bond (UNFCCC, 2023). The CFSDDS should also support credit enhancement by maintaining a capitalized fund  supported  by  multilateral  development  banks  (MDBs)  and  development  finance institutions (DFIs) to back guarantees for these transactions in a uniform fashion.

## Provide technical assistance to align KPIs with national and global goals

Debt swaps should shift from projects to programs through the use of budget support, where funds are paid directly into a debtor government's budget, allowing for a more cost-effective, strategic approach to delivering on SDGs (Steele and Patel, 2020). Such schemes would need to demonstrate minimum fiduciary standards, requiring countries to have certain  constraints  on  corruption  and  requirements  for  accountability  and  policy credibility. Budget tagging and tracking can be useful. When a new bond is issued as part of  the  transaction,  only  part  of  the  proceeds  raised  should  be  allocated  toward  SDGs investments. The rest should go towards increasing fiscal space.

In some cases, the lack of capacity for minimum fiduciary standards and the need for more complex financial structuring require arrangements to manage that complexity and ensure  the  faithful  execution  of  the  commitments.  Creating  a  uniform  governance structure-that provides credibility with the funds disbursed by boards with majority non-

<!-- image -->

government representation-could expedite and simplify the process. This process may have started based on the recent deals (Jain et al., 2023).

Swaps dealing with official creditors should be based on KPIs decided by the debtor aligning with their national plans and commitments, such as their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAPs), ensuring consistency with global targets and reducing monitoring costs. KPIs should be developed  through  a  broad  and  inclusive  in-country  consultation  process  and  then followed through transparent national verification systems, which include mechanisms for independent verification (UNDP, BIOFIN).

When swapping privately held debt, attaching KPIs from a harmonized list along with attaching  penalties  for  not  meeting  them-not  just  for  non-payments-can  help  both accelerate the transaction and mitigate the risk associated with monitoring investments that can vary considerably from one deal to another and could create uncertainty among private creditors (Jain et al., 2023).

## Scenario of Outcomes

Finding ways to scale up SDGs debt swaps could significantly contribute to the global effort  to  free  up  resources  in  heavily  indebted  EMDEs  to  invest  in  SDGs.  Our recommendations are a step in that direction. However, their implementation may not be straightforward as there are trade-offs involved.

The CFSDDS should learn from the CFDT experience (Georgieva and Pazarbasioglu, 2021) and create the right mechanisms and incentives to ensure the participation of a broad range of investors, especially when debt with official creditors is involved. For example, although China has been willing to participate in the CFDT, it has historically preferred bilateral negotiations and geopolitical tensions could exacerbate that. Private creditors tend to deny debt reductions when official creditors are slow to act (Canuto et al., 2023). It is also important to update the way rating agencies see debt swaps and not assign  default  ratings  when  they  occur  because  they  do  not  involve  involuntary transactions. Otherwise, this could deter some sovereigns from debt swaps.

Maintaining a capitalized fund to support the liquidity of these transactions may be constrained by balance sheet limitations of MDBs and DFIs, particularly if eligibility is extended and if the principal of the new bond has to be almost fully guaranteed (Jain et al  2023a).  Such  additional  funding  should  therefore  also  be  raised  from  developed economies, which is in line with their commitments to global climate and biodiversity targets.

Finally, the implementation of the programmatic approach and KPIs monitoring can be constrained by institutional weaknesses in EMDEs, such as corruption and lack of accountability. In contexts of economic instability, EMDEs tend to defund environmental institutions,  as  opposed  to  other  priorities.  It  is,  therefore,  important  not  only  to

consolidate the structures in charge of executing the debt swap but also to guarantee its financing and stability.

## Abstract

In  recent  years,  the  world  has  faced  a  widespread  polycrisis.  Depending  on  each region,  governments  have  chosen  different  approaches  to  face  it,  ranging  from  fiscal consolidation  programmes  to  expansionary  public  policy  through  relief  packages. However, a common challenge for many is the reduced, often shrinking, fiscal space. Fiscal consolidation has led to a reduction in allocation to public spending, which affects disadvantaged  groups,  especially  women.  Furthermore,  studies  highlight  that  fiscal policies, often perceived as gender-neutral, are gender-blind. The aim of gender equity needs greater alignment in international cooperation policies.

These challenges result in policies that deepen gender biases and move away from meeting SDG 5. Tax policy can help address these challenges when implemented from a gender perspective. However, according to OECD (2022), only twenty-two countries, including G20+ members, have implemented specific tax reforms for gender equity. In contrast,  gender-neutral  policies  prevail,  such  as  higher  tax  rates  on  second  earners, informal taxation or user fees for services used more by women, and low taxation on capital income or wealth.

In this context, enhancing gender-sensitive fiscal spaces is essential. The G20 provides a valuable platform for fostering multilateral commitments. The concrete proposals are: i) Promote an Engendered Fiscal Space Framework for better alignment of tax policies with  SDG  5;  (ii)  Help  G20  countries  build  tax  capacities  and  foster  international cooperation to facilitate the exchange of best practices and technical expertise, enabling nations to overcome common challenges and achieve sustainable progress towards SDG targets; (iii) Advance progressive tax systems by a) re-shaping the tax mix to reduce the tax  burden  on  low-income  earners,  b)  rationalize  the  use  of  tax  expenditures  and  c) increase taxation of the rich (Alstadsæter et al, 2024).

## Diagnosis of the issue

As the global economy shows signs of recovery, women remain disproportionately affected  by  enduring  inequalities.  Income-wage  disparities  and  unequal  labor  market participation persist. Although many countries have improved on the Gender Development  Index  (GDI)  post-pandemic,  the  Gender  Inequality  Index  (GII)  still undermines this progress by 40-45%. The correlation between GII values and the Global Social Norms Index (GSNI) reveals biases that influence gendered time-use outcomes, particularly in unpaid work (UNDP, 2024). In this crisis-ridden context, the exacerbation of inequalities demands immediate attention.

Six years remain to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and progress on Goal 5 is urgent, as over 80 countries are missing at least one indicator. Worsening food security has disproportionately impacted women, particularly in the Global South (GS), with over 340 million women and girls at risk of extreme poverty and 1 in 4 facing food insecurity (Figure 1). Achieving SDG-5 requires an estimated $6.4 trillion annually across 48 developing countries, plus an additional $360 billion for gender equality across all SDGs, including ending poverty and hunger (UN Women, 2023).

Rising debt levels and three years of slowing growth have limited fiscal space for financing the SDGs. Governments, especially finance ministers, should prioritize creating fiscal  space  through  gender-responsive  measures  to  enhance  women's  economic participation, thereby boosting productivity. Despite improvements in public spending through  Gender  Budgeting,  economic  policies  remain  largely  gender-neutral  (UN Women 2021). Implementing gender-sensitive tax systems will address inequalities and finance a sustainable recovery.

## Biases in taxation

Whether explicit or implicit, tax biases affect equity and fairness. Stotsky (1996) notes that  explicit  biases  directly  tied  to  gender  are  diminishing  because  they  are  easier  to identify. Conversely, implicit biases stem from societal norms, making them harder to detect and remedy.

The distributive effect of taxation varies by region. In advanced economies (AEs) with progressive structures, the GINI coefficient improves by nearly 20 points post-tax and transfers, while in the other two regions, it improves by less than 5 points (Figure 2). Prospects  for  inclusive  growth  relate  to  higher  education  levels,  increased  social spending,  and  more  redistributive  tax-benefit  systems,  as  shown  in  Developing  Asia. Strengthening tax equity is crucial in countries with high inequality and weak transfer systems.

According  to  the  OECD  (2022),  7  out  of  43  nations  have  tax  biases  discouraging married women from full-time work. In the GS, dominance of the informal sector hinders progress, employing women in casual or unpaid roles (Joshi et al., 2020). These effects are influenced by institutional conditions, cultural and socioeconomic factors.

While many countries address inequality through public spending, inequitable taxes worsen it. A common agenda recognizing each region's unique challenges and reforming tax  practices  exacerbating  gender  inequality  is  needed.  Tax  policy  evaluations  are essential for informing policymakers.

## Tax collection

Following the pandemic, fiscal challenges remain. While some high-income countries implemented  innovative gender-sensitive fiscal policies,  many  GS  countries are struggling  with  high  public  debt  burdens.  In  recent  decades,  European  tax  policies focused  on  economic  growth  and  optimal  taxation  lack  gender  considerations.  Labor taxes  dominate  revenues,  with  declining  progressivity,  while  wealth-based  taxes  are insufficient. Regressive Value Added Taxes (VAT) have grown, exacerbating tax burdens in lower-income groups (Gunnarsson et al., 2017).

Within  the  GS,  Africa,  Asia-Pacific,  and  LAC  exhibit  low  tax  collection  rates, averaging 15.6, 19.8, and 21.7% of GDP, respectively, compared to the OECD's 34.2% in 2021. In the three regions, indirect taxes represent nearly half of total revenue (onethird in OECD's-Figure 3).

## International cooperation for achieving SDGs

Various initiatives aim to establish an International Taxation Cooperation Framework, but global consensus is lacking. The OECD framework (Pillars I and II) benefits AEs, but lacks  inclusiveness.  In  2023,  the  Africa  Group  proposed  a  UN  resolution  for  fairer

international  taxation1.  Two  concerns emerge:  i)  the  OECD and UN Tax Convention should mainstream human rights and gender perspectives, and ii) successful international tax cooperation depends on countries' ability to capitalize on institutional developments. The G20 can play a crucial role in coordinating new initiatives for inclusive and genderresponsive tax frameworks.

## Recommendations

Our recommendations for the G20 focus on three core pillars: (i) foster an Engendered Fiscal Space Framework that ensures fairer redistribution of resources; (ii) Help build tax capacities and foster international cooperation to facilitate the exchange of best practices and technical expertise, overcome common challenges and achieve sustainable progress towards SDG targets; (iii) Advance progressive tax systems by prioritizing the reduction in taxes for low-income earners and avoid harmful explicit biases in tax regulations.

## Engendered Fiscal Space Framework (EFSF)

Women are placed in vulnerable situations, exacerbated by ongoing polycrises. Tax systems  can  significantly  shape  gender  disparities  if  ill-designed.  Engendering  fiscal space through progressive taxes, combating tax evasion, and eliminating inequitable tax expenditures (TEs) is crucial. The framework ensures resources for gender responsive and transformative policies towards a more inclusive society.

Achieving SDG-5 and overall SDG progress depends on gender equality in taxation. The EFSF integrates tax cooperation, placing women at the center of fiscal policy (Figure 4). Making the EFSF a natural part of every decision making process, each nation can develop equitable tax systems.

The rationale for this stems from three facts:

- Global variations in labor market inequalities demand tailored fiscal policies (Chancel et al, 2022).
- Differing  tax  burdens  across  regions  can  disproportionately  affect  women, especially in the GS (IMF, 2023).
- Economic and social contexts vary, impacting the fairness and effectiveness of fiscal policies (ILO, 2021).

The  OECD/G20  Inclusive  Framework  has  proposed  a  Multilateral  Convention  to integrate fiscal and monetary frameworks, strengthening multilateral tax cooperation. The 2024 Summit for the Future is crucial for G20 countries to emphasize that accelerating

SDGs  requires  gendering  macroeconomic  policies  and  cooperation for equitable outcomes (OECD, 2023).

## Building capacities and fostering international partnerships for SDGs

The  international  tax  policy  landscape  necessitates  multilaterally  agreed  rules  and tools to improve tax administration and cooperation. G20 strategies require strong fiscal management, investment in institutional capacity, gender-sensitive revenue analysis, and measures against cross-border tax evasion.

If companies are multinational, tax policies should also be global. Tax evasion costs governments $480 billion annually, significantly impacting developing countries, which lose $47 billion, compared to $433 billion for high-income countries (representing 49% vs. 9% of health budgets) (Tax Justice Network, 2023). This reduces fiscal space and exacerbates inequalities.

The "Tax Cooperation for the 21st Century" report and the 'G20/OECD Roadmap on Developing  Countries  and  International  Taxation  Update  2023'  recommend  full participation by developing countries in global tax initiatives, with support from AEs. However, these documents lack a gender perspective. The G20 plays a crucial role in promoting fiscal justice and facilitating knowledge transfer, acknowledging that fiscal policies  are  not  gender-neutral.  Implementing  socially  sensitive  tax  reforms  requires stable  leadership  to  overcome  political  obstacles:  global  platforms  provide  steady initiatives.

## Securing real wages of women: Priorities in taxation policies

## A. Taxation of labor income

Progressive  tax  systems  can  directly  reduce  post-tax  inequality  and  narrow  gender gaps in net incomes. In order to promote female labor force participation, taxes for lowincome earners should be reduced and explicit biases avoided. Gendered rules govern shared  income  attribution  and  differential  tax  rates  based  on  income  type  (labor  or financial). Individual filing for personal income tax helps mitigate bias from joint filing, increasingly adopted by countries.

## B. Taxation of wealth

The gender wealth gap is substantial and wider than the income gap globally, with women comprising only 12% of the richest individuals. Legal differences in inheritance, asset ownership, and credit access contribute to this disparity. In 2020, nearly 40% of economies limited women's property rights (World Bank, 2021). The global income gap and limited access to finance restrict women's investment, savings, and asset acquisition.

Taxing wealth can target net wealth, returns, or transfers. Hebous et al. (2024) suggest taxing  returns  are  less  distortive,  but  when  limited  to  the  super-rich,  wealth  taxes' administrative costs are reduced. Both methods enhance tax progressivity and increase the fiscal space. A net wealth tax on the super-rich ensures steady revenue, while estate taxes can counter wealth accumulation in countries without them. An already proposed 2% minimum tax on super-rich wealth to the G20 finance ministers 2 could raise revenue,

improve tax compliance, and facilitate broader tax reforms, reinforcing social cohesion amidst growing inequality.

## C. Taxation of capital income

Gender-based  income  inequality  favors  men  in  top  income  brackets.  Additionally, women face barriers to financial access for business ventures due to factors like lower assets and financial literacy. The preferential tax treatment of capital income (Perret et. al,  2023), common in most countries, undermines tax system fairness and exacerbates gender disparities by favoring the richest men. Fairer taxation of capital gains could help mitigate wealth and income gaps.

## D. Tax expenditures (TEs)

TEs result in a revenue loss for governments, amounting to around 3.8% of GDP and 23% of tax revenue worldwide (von Haldenwang et al., 2023). It is essential to rationalize their use, remove those shown as inefficient and ineffective, and design TEs to be genderresponsive and transformative. Redonda et al. (2023) noted that among 106 countries with publicly available TE reports, only 16 included evaluations, with merely two conducting gender-specific assessments of TEs. Evaluating the impact of TEs is crucial for enhancing policy efficiency and assessing the often hidden impact on gender. Challenges include a lack of gender-disaggregated data, methodological guidance, and institutional capacity. Addressing these challenges is vital for ensuring equitable fiscal policies.

## Expected outcomes

The EFSF envisions three significant outcomes: i) increased fiscal space, ii) inclusive gender results and iii) G20+ and international cooperation for achieving SDGs

## Increased fiscal space

Achieving SDGs requires increased tax revenue together with economic growth and strong  institutions.  Through  more  effective  revenue  collection,  increased  revenue  can finance  public  spending  and  enhance  trust,  but  it  necessitates  tailored  institutional investments (Figure 5). Tax collection capacity relies on state capability. Benitez et al. (2023) reveal the potential for significant tax revenue increases: Low-income developing countries (LIDCs) by 6.7 p.p., Emerging market economies (EMEs) by 5 p.p. and AEs by  1.5  p.p.  of  GDP.  LIDCs  can  further  improve  their  potential  by  adopting  EMEs institutions (2.3%).

Across the globe, women in low-income brackets face a disproportionate tax burden due to biases in consumption patterns. To effectively address this issue, implementing public provisions alongside a robust and strengthened tax administration could result in VAT being applied more progressively. Ultimately, improved fiscal administration will also combat tax avoidance and mitigate negative externalities arising from tax evasion.

## Inclusive gender outcomes

Since wealth is highly concentrated at the top of the income distribution, where men are overrepresented, the introduction of a net wealth tax on the super-rich would impact the  gender  distribution.  The  2%  global  minimum  tax  for  the  super-rich  targets  2500 individuals expecting to raise approximately $214 billion annually (Alstadsæter et al., 2024).

Gender disparities in income and wealth perpetuate the underrepresentation of women in top capital income brackets, so lower capital income tax rates disproportionately favor men,  widening  gender  gaps.  Aligning  capital  gains  taxation  with  labor  income  could alleviate wealth disparities, necessitating complementary reforms to mitigate potential behavioral changes. Research shows no economic benefit from cutting capital income taxes in the US, and optimal rates can be higher. This requires complementary reforms, like taxing gains at death and introducing a net wealth tax, to discourage asset holding and increase tax progressivity (Matsui et al., 2022).

Progressive  tax  systems  increase  female  labor  force  participation  in  low-income brackets by balancing revenue from high-income earners for lower tax rates. Coelho et al (2022) found that progressive direct taxes reduce the gap in women's income relative to men's by about 1.4 p.p. in AEs and about 0.3 p.p. in EMEs. While AEs have seen gender

gaps in net incomes narrow, the impact has been minimal in EMEs due to less progressive tax systems. Tax provisions, social security contributions, welfare and fringe benefits can influence household finances and labor dynamics, encouraging secondary earners, often women, to engage in formal employment when designed with a gender equal lens and tailored to diverse household structures and spending habits.

## G20+ and international cooperation for achieving SDGs

The  current  global  cooperation  system  faces  challenges  in  achieving  multiple development  agendas,  including  climate,  finance,  and  the  SDGs.  The  pandemic  and recent  global  crises  worsen  economic  prospects.  Meeting  these  challenges  demands increased  political  and  financial  commitments  from  both  Global  and  South  countries, primarily to address lagging progress in SDG-5 and women's empowerment across other SDGs. Between 2021-2022, 43% of bilateral allocable Official Development Assistance (ODA) prioritized gender equality, amounting to $64.1 billion, slightly down from 45% in 2019-2020 (Figure 6). The majority, $58.3 billion (39%), supported programs with integrated gender equality objectives. Despite the UN Tax Convention aims to enhance SDG  policy  and  implementation  strategies  (gender  equality  in  capacity  building, governance, and technology transfers), challenges persist within the complex landscape of bilateral development assistance.

The discourse on taxation requires a comprehensive international approach, considering globalization and the digital economy. This strategy must include gendersensitive  policies  to  ensure  gender  fairness.  Initiatives  like  Feminist  International Relations, endorsed by several G20 nations (UN Women, 2022), advocate for feminist international cooperation, addressing tax and transparency legislation.

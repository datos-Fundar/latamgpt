This route focuses on Bloomwork as a strong and friendly flourishing community, with a not too serious tone of voice.

The graphic sign evokes the shape of an opening flower, in a geometrical way, bringing a playful and modern image to the brand.

We decided to tweak the two « o » to evokes two identities, two people meeting and connecting.

The chosen font, Aventa, is minimalist and modern, with an interesting typographic work made on the «  w  », the «  r  » and the «  k  », which allows it to stand out from other typefaces, and to give it a friendly and digital look.

The graphic sign can also be used on different mediums such as an asterisk, which allows us to play with double meaning in copywriting.

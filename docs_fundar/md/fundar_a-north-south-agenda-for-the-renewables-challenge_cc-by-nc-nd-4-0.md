## Abstract

Achieving the COP28 pledge of tripling renewable energy capacity by 2030 is crucial to tackle the climate crisis. Such a substantial and rapid shift poses challenges that need to be addressed to ensure the equity of the energy transition.

Three key challenges emerge. Firstly, minerals used in the renewable value chain are unevenly  distributed  geographically.  This  not  only  presents  supply  risks  but  also concentrates environmental and social impacts associated with mining in specific areas, while  the  majority  of  extraction  benefits  accrue  elsewhere.  Secondly,  insufficient financing in the Global South can delay renewable energy deployment, and barriers to entering high-value segments in green value chains may result in an energy transition that disproportionately benefits advanced economies. Lastly, weak governance mechanisms amid large flows of financing, rapid investment scale-up and expectations of high returns in  renewable energy projects can pose corruption risks and can result in violations of community rights, which may undermine societal support of the sector's growth.

Thus, to  ensure  a  just  tripling  of  renewable  energy  capacity,  it  is  crucial  to promote  sustainable  supply  chains,  provide  equitable  access  to  finance  and technology,  create  opportunities  for  industrial  capacity-building,  and  strengthen transparency, accountability, and anti-corruption policies.

## Diagnosis of the Issue

The deployment of renewable energies emerges as one of the most powerful tools to tackle the climate crisis. Building upon this foundation, at the COP28 conference, more than 130 countries pledged to triple renewable energy capacity by 2030. However, a shift of this scale and pace poses challenges that could compromise both the progress and the equity of the energy transition.

The issues typically addressed in achieving this target are potential bottlenecks tied to technical,  operational,  and  geopolitical  aspects.  Nevertheless,  often  overlooked  are distributive and justice aspects crucial to ensuring a fair and beneficial deployment of renewables for all countries. The energy transition can be a unique opportunity to build a more inclusive and fairer energy system, economy and society, encouraging engagement from all nations and regions.

The populations of developing countries need a just transition that not only contributes to  global  environmental  goals  but  also  enhances  their  quality  of  life. This  calls  for  a holistic  governance  framework  that  considers  each  of  the  challenges  inherent  to  the development  of  the  renewable  value  chain,  from  critical  minerals  (CM)  extraction  to renewables' deployment.

The  first challenge  is ensuring  sustainable  supply  chains.  The  transition  will exponentially increase demand for CM, creating both opportunities and risks for countries and stakeholders situated  in  different  segments  of  the  renewables  global  value  chain. While  developed  countries  in  the  North  strive  to  secure  stable  supply  of  CM  amidst geopolitical tensions (Andreoni and Roberts 2022; Narula et al 2023), CM resources are concentrated in a handful of countries, many of which are situated in the Global South. This creates a sustainability paradox : in these countries the transition toward a cleaner

<!-- image -->

energy matrix is associated with increasing environmental, social and governance risks (Marin and Goya 2021, Obaya et al 2024a).

There is a growing recognition that securing a reliable supply of CM cannot come at the expense of labor rights, the environment or local communities. This led to initiatives such as the Mineral Security Partnership or the European Critical Raw Materials Act, that set standards for CM suppliers' projects. Still, the views and objectives of actors in CMproducing and in green-technology-producing countries only partially align, potentially resulting in critical  issues  being  overlooked in the international agenda  (Obaya et  al., 2024b). In many CM producing countries, there is a demand for the minerals sector to deliver  lasting  economic  benefits,  including  playing  a  bigger  role  in  the  mid-  and downstream of the mineral value chain. As part of this, stakeholders expect productive and technological capacity building to be part of multilateral agreements.

The second challenge thus involves ensuring fair access to the opportunities emerging from the expansion of renewables. The investment flows and the technological revolution propelled by the deployment of renewables presents an opportunity for countries to foster economic growth, enhance resilience, and guarantee energy access for all. Nevertheless, insufficient financing in developing countries can delay renewable energy deployment, and barriers to accessing high-value segments in green value chains can lead to an energy transition  that  disproportionately  favors  advanced  economies.  Global  financing  for renewable energy already reflects substantial inequities. Investments in renewables have nearly  tripled  since  2015,  but  most  of  the  money  has  gone  to  developed  countries (UNCTAD, 2023), while the regions home to most developing and emerging markets receive comparatively low investments.

Furthermore,  this  already  limited  funding  directed  towards  developing  countries predominantly  consists  in  deploying  turnkey  renewable  energy  projects,  often  with minimal  involvement  of  local  stakeholders.  This  has  resulted  in  developed  countries capitalizing on most of the opportunities presented by the green technological revolution: their exports of green technology surged by 160% from 2018 to 2021, while developing countries experienced a modest 32% increase in green exports and saw their global export share  decline  from  48%  to  33%  (UNCTAD,  2023).  This  growing  technology  gap underscores  the  imperative  for  global  mechanisms  of  solidarity,  which  should  enable developing  countries  to  access  the  benefits  of  the  green  revolution,  thereby  fostering collective economic growth alongside climate change mitigation.

The third challenge stems from weak governance mechanisms that, amidst large flows of financing, rapid scale-up in investment, and expectations of high returns, can drive

corruption and violations of community rights. Corruption creates operational, reputational, and legal challenges that not only harm the investment climate and escalate business costs, but also create barriers to the sector's growth by eroding public trust. Weak governance risks creating unfair outcomes for local stakeholders, especially remote or indigenous  communities. Areas  of  concern  include  auction  and  permitting  processes, subsidy  schemes,  negotiations  over  grid connection, contestation of land rights, arguments  over  benefit  sharing,  and  disputes  over  community  consent. A  just  energy transition is a shared responsibility between governments, companies and civil society organizations. Therefore it is essential for all stakeholders to be involved in ensuring a transparent process that addresses governance and corruption risks.

## Recommendations

The following recommendations are presented not as an exhaustive compilation of best practices, but to address key gaps and critical issues along the renewable value chain.

## · Promoting  inclusive  criteria  for  stakeholder  engagement  and  decisionmaking along the renewables global value chain.

Inclusive  criteria  for  extensive  stakeholder  engagement  may  provide  a  guiding principle  for  establishing  sustainable  supply  chains  as  a  key  component  of  a  just transition. A holistic governance framework is needed to address the existing challenges across the entire value chain, particularly in mineral production, which faces the most significant environmental, social, and governance risks.

In mineral producing countries, addressing the impacts of CM production at the local level  requires  being  innovative  in  terms  of  integrating  stakeholder  engagement  and participation in decision-making. Multi-stakeholder initiatives like the Extractive Industries  Transparency  Initiative  (EITI),  could  address  social,  environmental,  and governance challenges through inclusive participatory mechanisms, including promoting transparency on application of the principle of Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC). This is particularly important when the domestic institutional and legal environment in which companies operate does not contemplate provisions for addressing them (Narula et al., 2023). A critical dimension of meaningful participation in these initiatives is the access to reliable information as a necessary step for building public trust in institutions and  organizations. At  a  project  level,  this  means  the  development  of  monitoring  and follow-up systems on mining project indicators, integrating perspectives of local actors,

<!-- image -->

communities and indigenous people, to ensure high-quality information and address the multiple asymmetries that characterize the interaction between actors.

Multi-stakeholder initiatives need to be complemented by strengthening domestic institutional arrangements and building legal and technical capacities by national and subnational states in less developed countries . A recent study on the sustainability of  lithium-ion  battery  supply  chains  -  essential  for  storage  technologies  that  enable increased penetration of renewable energies into electrical grids - highlights this as a primary necessity (Figure 2).

Although  multi-stakeholder  mechanisms  are particularly vital at the resource extraction  stage  of  the  value  chain,  they  need  to  be  developed  throughout  the  entire

<!-- image -->

process, as the deployment of renewable energy projects can also create tensions with local communities.

For participatory mechanisms to be effective, they must be accompanied by a process of institutional and capacity building that includes both public actors and civil society. G20 countries could offer technical and financial support to build such capacities by incorporating  these  topics  into  Memorandums  of  Understanding  or  cooperation programs with multilateral organizations (Obaya et al., 2024b).

## · Establish shared principles for transparency and good governance for the development of renewables projects.

The renewable energy sector needs a shared approach for preventing governance and corruption  risks.  Drawing  lessons  from  extractive  industries,  the  G20  could  define common principles  for  transparency  and  accountability  for  government  and  industry. Building  on  a  call  to  action  launched  at  COP28  by  the  EITI,  REN21  and  other stakeholders, these principles could set a benchmark for good practice in areas such as the disclosure of information on taxes and subsidies, licensing and contracting, beneficial ownership and supply chain due diligence. They could also include measures that help to mitigate  risks  for  communities,  including  transparency  on  consultation  and  consent processes, environmental and social impact assessments and community benefits.

Experience in implementing standards like the EITI in the extractive industries shows how transparency and multi-stakeholder dialogue can build trust between actors who may have  conflicting  agendas.  Through  this  mechanism  both  government  agencies  and companies  commit  to  disclosing  information  to  the  public  and  adopt  a  series  of expectations  aimed  at  strengthening  transparency  and  compliance  mechanisms  (EITI, 2022). On their part, civil society organizations take the responsibility of advancing and

<!-- image -->

scrutinizing the disclosure of information, including tax payments, contracts and licenses, and environmental and social impacts. This  approach could serve as a model for the renewable  energy  sector  to  address  tensions  deriving  from  the  development  of  large projects. Understanding communities' information needs is crucial for empowering them to be a part of decision-making processes.

## · Fulfilling of the Paris Financing Commitments and Supporting Renewable Investments

To meet the emission targets of the Paris Agreement, investments in renewable energy in developing countries need to more than triple , rising from USD 770 billion in 2022 to USD 2.8 trillion by the early 2030s (IEA and IFC, 2023). To help developing countries  meet  these  investment  objectives,  developed  nations  committed  to  allocate funds  to  bolster  their  mitigation  efforts.  Nevertheless,  timely  financial  disbursements faced delays and fell short, posing a hurdle to their effectiveness. Ensuring the reliable delivery of these funds is imperative to effectively address worldwide climate objectives.

Additionally,  in  the  developing  world,  the  cost  of  capital  serves  as  a  barrier  to renewable energy investments, considering them riskier endeavors. Addressing this issue requires  two  key  actions.  Firstly,  strengthening  state  capacities  to  enhance  regulatory frameworks and improve access to finance could help to overcome current obstacles to clean energy investments (IEA and IFC, 2023) and to translate energy transition targets into  actionable  investment  plans.  Secondly,  reducing  the  cost  of  capital  through mechanisms that include grants and partnerships between the public sector, international investors and multilateral financial institutions could significantly reduce the spread of debt finance (UNCTAD, 2023).

## ● Creation of an Initiative for Cooperation in Innovation and  Green Technology among the G20 nations with a North-South approach

Given the higher opportunity and complexity of green value chains, integration in them is  crucial  for  developing  countries.  However, the opening of green windows does not happen  naturally. Countries  furthest  from  the  green  technological  frontier  cannot seize opportunities without the international community's support. To address this challenge, G20 countries could promote an Initiative for Cooperation in Innovation and Green Technology based on three pillars: (i)  technology  transfer;  (ii)  global cooperation mechanisms in R&amp;D; and (iii) new trade mechanisms to support the enhancement of technological capacity in developing countries.

Firstly,  there  is  a  need  to  expedite  the  transfer  of  capital  goods  and  equipment  to developing countries, combined with a strong focus on empowering individuals to acquire the  necessary  skills  for  operating  and  maintaining  such  equipment  (know-how)  and understanding its operational principles (know-why) (UNCDAT, 2023).

Secondly, inequality in technological development stems  from  uneven  R&amp;D investments among countries. As developing nations grapple with economic and social challenges, coupled with the escalating impacts of climate change, their investments in R&amp;D lag behind those of developed countries (Table 1). This bias can be reduced by transitioning research efforts from national to global scales, establishing multinational research platforms, and fostering open innovation, thereby making findings accessible to international experts and knowledge communities.

| IIndonesia     | 0.28 (2020)                |

Thirdly,  international  support  for  green  innovation  should  put  more  emphasis  on enhancing innovative capacities in developing countries to independently adapt and adopt green  technologies,  devise  local  solutions,  and  generate  employment. As  part  of  this process, the G20 countries should encourage new trade mechanisms to support the development of innovation and technological capacity in developing countries. On the  supply  side,  development  assistance  could  be  used  to  help  developing  countries emulate the production of more industrialized countries. On the demand side, developed

<!-- image -->

nations could open their markets to production from latecomer economies (UNCDAT, 2023). Complementing these policies, developing countries should elaborate initiatives aimed at enhancing local capacities and creating employment based on regulations that require  local  components  in  new  renewable  energy  projects,  training  and  retraining programs for workers shifting from the fossil fuel industry, and requirements of local ownership in energy projects (REN21, 2023).

## Scenario of Outcomes

The  implementation  of  these  recommendations  aims  to  strengthen  the  connection between climate mitigation and a more equitable world.

Firstly, the  implementation  of  transparency,  good  governance  and  multistakeholder dialogue mechanisms play a crucial role in ensuring a fair process of renewables' deployment. Implementing such measures can effectively avoid the backand-forth of socio-environmental or legal conflicts that may arise at each stage associated with the renewable energy value chain.  This would contribute to a scenario of reduced uncertainty and increased diligence in achieving the goal of tripling renewable energy capacity.

Secondly, moving  beyond  a  narrow  focus  that  solely  tracks  the  aggregated deployment  of  renewables  at  a  global  level  and  instead  advocating  for  a  more comprehensive  approach  that  acknowledges  the  barriers  faced  by  developing countries-both in accessing financing for renewable projects and in successfully integrating  into  green  technology  segments-is  an  effective  means  of  ensuring equitable  and  sustained  progress  of  the  decarbonization  process. This  involves avoiding resource concentration, promoting fair financial distribution across regions, and collaborating  to  ensure  renewables  benefit  capacity  building  and  job  creation  in developing nations. Faltering in this endeavor risks widening gaps between developed and developing countries, which could hinder the transition as nations may choose to capitalize on their competitiveness in less sustainable but more familiar industries, seeing limited prospects in green sectors.

However,  it's  important  to  acknowledge  that  these  scenarios  are  not  without challenges.  Setting  up  the  structures  of  accountability  mechanisms  and  information platforms can be costly in terms of both time and money, considerations that should be

<!-- image -->

included into project planning. Additionally, as the competitive advantage a nation holds in a particular technology is closely tied to its cost efficiency in production, venturing into less competitive countries could potentially elevate product prices, impacting deployment costs  and  overall  energy  expenses.  Furthermore,  the  time-intensive  nature  of  capacity acquisition  may  introduce  delays  that  could  delay  the  timely  transition  to  renewable energy.

While the tensions and trade-offs described are significant, they should not be seen as obstacles to the energy transition. Instead, they should be seen as essential factors for ensuring  a  fair  and  equitable  process. Strengthening  governance  and  including economic and social development in the COP28 renewable pledge is a compelling driver  that  will  motivate  nations  to  proactively  engage  in  sustainable  renewable energy transition, and position renewable energy as a catalyst for broader societal and economic development.

## Abstract

Latin America, currently the most urbanized region with 80% of people residing in cities, faces challenges due to unplanned urbanization, resulting in 113 million people living in informal settlements (UN, 2020). This concentrated structural poverty (Barrett, C., &amp; Carter, M., 2013) represents a significant obstacle to poverty reduction and social inclusion.

Recognizing  this  is  crucial  for  redefining  the  problem.  It  extends  beyond  land occupation  or  substandard  construction  quality;  it  involves  excluded  neighborhoods lacking  basic  services,  public  transportation,  and  security.  Consequently,  the  current challenge is to integrate these neighborhoods into the city and vice versa.

Living  conditions  in  these  neighborhoods  hinder  both  individual  and  national development.  A  key  aspect  is  recognizing  that  those  born  in  these  areas  face  more disadvantages. It is logical that progress is harder when born into a home that floods with every rain, lacks internet access, potable water, recreational spaces, and adequate lighting for nighttime safety.

The socio-urban integration policy proposes a comprehensive approach to address this issue by creating equality in initial conditions to foster development.

Based  on  experiences  in  designing  and  implementing  these  processes,  we  propose recommendations focusing on two main aspects: incorporating participatory methodologies  to  ensure process implementation  and  sustainability  and  working comprehensively on three main dimensions: urban integration, housing, and socioeconomic aspects.

Key  words: urbanization-  informal  settlements-  structural  poverty-  social  exclusionsocio urban integration- participatory methodologies- housing deficit- public servicessocial  infrastructure-  sustainable  development-  economic  empowerment-  sustainable cities.

## Diagnosis of the Issue

Latin  America  and  the  Caribbean  (LAC)  experience  rapid  urbanization  and  the resulting  social  exclusion  pose  significant  challenges  to  achieving  inclusive  and sustainable  cities.  In  LAC,  the  Gini  inequality  index  declined  on  average  by  1.1% annually between

2019 and 2022, but income gaps continue to be very high across the region and are exacerbated by the concentration of wealth (CEPAL, 2023).

Compared to other urban residents, people living in informal settlements, especially in marginalized  neighborhoods,  experience  greater economic,  social, and  spatial exclusion from the benefits and opportunities of the broader urban environment (UNHabitat, 2015). " Rapid urbanization and rapid growth of large cities in low- and middleincome countries have been accompanied by the rapid growth of highly vulnerable urban communities living in informal settlements ' (IPCC Fifth Assessment Report, 2014; cited by  Satterthwaite  et  al.,  2020,  p.  145).  More  than  100  million  people  live  in  informal settlements  in  LAC  (UN-Habitat,  2020),  meaning  one  in  five  people  in  the  region experiences conditions of social exclusion.

The problem stems from social exclusion as a consequence of rapid and unplanned urbanization.  This  impedes  development  and  the  creation  of  inclusive  cities,  turning urban  areas  into  hubs  of  structural  poverty.  During  the  1950s,  many  countries experimented with policies of slum eradication and relocation. These policies failed and led to the proliferation of informal settlements, which in the 1960s and 1970s prompted massive public housing construction. It was believed that the core of the problem lay in the  poor  housing  conditions  of  the  impoverished,  so  the  proposed  solution  was  to construct public units at relatively low costs (Rondinelli, 1990). This not only imposed high costs on the government-associated with housing construction-but also failed to

achieve the desired effects on the population, as it did not consider the sustainability of the new habitat or the importance of the environment, resulting in high economic costs (housing maintenance) and significant problems related to social displacement (Rondinelli, 1990).

Today, informal settlements continue to be a major challenge for development in LAC, as well as for other regions of the world. There are significant deficits in housing, access to  basic  services,  and  labor  informality.  Addressing  this  problem  requires  a  broader perspective: not only a housing-specific issue but also the exclusionary situation of living in these areas. In this context, the notion of socio-urban integration has emerged as a new paradigm, adopting a more holistic perspective that emphasizes the issue of exclusion.

The integration of informal settlements emerges as a crucial priority for the G20, given the extensive population living under these conditions in the LAC region. The holistic approach aligns with the United Nations' SDGs, particularly 11 (aiming to achieve more inclusive and sustainable cities), 10 (focused on reducing inequalities), and 6 (directed at ensuring access to clean water). It has been demonstrated that urbanization processes can not  only  improve  living  conditions,  including  health  (SDG  3)  but  also  have  positive effects on the environment (SDG 13) and climate change mitigation.

## Recommendations

Social-urban  integration  is  proposed  as  a  public  policy  tool  to  address  habitat  in informal settlements, social exclusion, and structural poverty.

The adoption of this public policy is essential to overcome structural poverty, prevalent in Latin America but also strongly present in Africa and Asia. This entails investing in social infrastructure to change the structural conditions that limit people's development, ensuring that informal settlements have the same conditions as formal neighborhoods. It is crucial for G20 countries to make efforts to promote comprehensive and participatory projects by funding and promoting cooperation and knowledge exchange among different countries to replicate these experiences.

In this vein, we developed two key recommendations, fundamental to maximize the impacts of informal settlement integration:

## 1. Incorporating  participatory  strategies  in  informal  settlement  integration projects at every stage.

It's recommended that participatory strategies be integrated into informal settlement integration projects at every stage. Community involvement should be central, leading to significant changes in public policy and resident decision-making roles, ensuring project sustainability and positive impact.

Community participation is crucial for the success of an urban integration project. According to the Latin American Observatory at The New School (2020), participatory methods  enhance  project  impact,  even  amid  economic  fluctuations  and  regulatory changes. The New Urban Agenda (2017) emphasizes inclusive participation and social cohesion for sustainable urban development.

A notable example is Villa 20 in Buenos Aires. Since 2016, the city government, with CAF funding,  has  employed  a  participatory  planning  model.  This  approach  involves residents in co-designing project outcomes through various participatory mechanisms, as opposed to top-down imposition (Almansi et al. 2020). Therefore, specific recommendations are:

- Incorporating  Participatory  Methodologies  in  Project  Design: create  real opportunities for public opinion, participation, and evaluation throughout all stages of the project through specific participatory devices that promote joint decision-making and comanagement among various actors (CAF, 2020).
- Design  and  Implementation  of  Participatory  Devices: Participatory  devices should be flexible and horizontal to facilitate decision-making and project adaptation to the complex problems presented by each context. To ensure their sustained implementation,  the  institutionalization  of  created  devices  is  fundamental.  Successful examples, such as the Mesas de Gestión Participativa (MGP) in Villa 20, Buenos Aires, show that these devices can be institutionalized through local legislation, guaranteeing their legitimacy and effectiveness (Almansi et al. 2020).
- Benefits  and  Sustainability: Community  participation  not  only  increases residents' satisfaction and the appropriation of new housing spaces but also, investment in participatory processes is relatively low (1.3% of the total cost of the process-project), yet  it  generates  high  levels  of  long-term  commitment  to  the  project  (New  School Observatory, 2020).

## 2. The development of a comprehensive approach to socio-urban integration processes that takes into account three basic dimensions:

- Housing dimension: It  focuses on ensuring the minimum living conditions for the population living in informal settlements. This aims to mainly resolve the qualitative housing deficit,  ensuring  that  households  have  formal  connections  for  access  to  basic services. Additionally, it seeks to provide legal certainty for those who inhabit these areas, meaning that the occupation ceases to be informal. This point is key to generating both the rights and obligations that arise from this certainty.

In this regard, we highlight the interventions carried out in Barrio Mugica in the City of  Buenos  Aires.  As  part  of  a  comprehensive  plan  for  social,  urban,  and  economic integration,  this  World  Bank-funded  project  developed  two  components  aimed  at reducing the housing deficit: the Housing Improvement Program and the Resettlement Program. The first focuses on improving the exteriors and structures of existing homes, as  well  as  promoting  other  actions  such  as  connecting  to  public  services  and  interior improvements  through  self-construction.  The  second  focuses  on  families  living  in dangerous locations (such as under the highway) who were offered the opportunity to move  to  new  homes  built  for  this  purpose  in  the  vicinity  of  the  neighborhood.  This program has contributed to improving the quality of life for families in the neighborhood, as  evidenced  by  improved  indicators  related  to  overcrowding  and  perceived  security (Suaya et al. 2021). However, the study conducted by CIPPEC (2021) also highlights the importance  of  strengthening  in-situ  housing  improvement  policies  to  scale  up  this initiative.

- Urban dimension: Conceptually, it focuses on the urban development of each neighborhood. The goal is to connect the neighborhoods to the city and vice versa. It prioritizes access to basic public service infrastructure (water, sewage, electricity, and

telecommunications) and the improvement of public space by opening and optimizing streets and access roads to facilitate mobility, as well as the construction and revitalization of green areas.

The Programa  de  Mejoramiento  Urbano in  Mexico  exemplifies  urban  dimension intervention through a participatory urban design approach. Initiated in 2019, it has been implemented in 26 states and 162 municipalities across Mexico. The program involves stakeholders from the formal city structure to collaborate on settlements and prioritizes basic  service  infrastructure  and  community  facility  projects.  From  2019  to  2023,  the program benefited 9.5 million people, constructed over 25,000 housing improvements, generated 410,000 jobs, and received 122 national and international awards. The scope of the intervention includes 9 million m², encompassing the development of public spaces and  the  provision  of  essential  utilities  to  marginalized  communities,  significantly enhancing living conditions and promoting social inclusion.

- Socioeconomic dimension: When it became evident that the issue of informal settlements could not be resolved solely through the construction of housing and urban infrastructure, efforts began to focus on social and economic development. The goal is to complement housing and service works with a focus on human development, ensuring the presence of the state through essential social services such as education, health, and security,  thereby  promoting  integration  into  the  socio-urban  fabric.  Additionally,  the people in these neighborhoods work and generate economic value, even though most of this work is informal. Therefore, the objective of socioeconomic interventions should be to improve the productivity of this sector and create conditions to integrate the work into formal value chains, breaking the cycle of extreme poverty and social exclusion. This involves working on skills development, formalizing activities, and access to financing. In this context, we highlight two successful experiences:

- o Centros  Comunitarios  de  Paz  (Compaz)  in  Recife,  Brazil :  This  project promoted the development of social infrastructure to reduce violence levels and improve the  quality  of  life.  According  to  Santos  (2022),  the  pillars  of  COMPAZ  are  social urbanism,  service  centers,  citizen  coexistence,  economic  empowerment,  a  culture  of peace, and early childhood care. This program has been recognized for its measurable social  impact,  with  intensive  use  of  its  facilities  and  a  decrease  in  violence  levels, achievements recognized by the UN in 2022.

## o Centro  de  Desarrollo  Emprendedor  y  Laboral  (CeDEL)  in  Buenos  Aires,

Argentina: The local government implemented policies focused on job training, market identification, skill development, and soft skills enhancement. Distinctive components of this experience include (i) the creation of two major work streams: tools to strengthen local  production  and employment promotion, both with offices located in each of the popular neighborhoods; (ii) these actions were supported by normative frameworks for systemic changes and innovative tools, directing social investment towards economicproductive  logics  (Popular  Economy  Law  and  Economic  Integration  Law);  and  (iii) strengthened collaboration with the private sector, universities, and  third sector organizations,  which  were  invited  to  participate  by  providing  training,  mentorship, monitoring, and evaluation.

Based on these experiences, we recommend:

- Skills Development and Formalization of Activities: Invest in skills development programs to improve opportunities for access to the formal labor market. Promote the formalization of informal, productive activities through specific normative frameworks.

- Social  Infrastructure: Invest  in  social  infrastructure  projects  that  promote community development and violence reduction, establishing accessible physical spaces for the provision of essential social services, following successful examples like Recife.
- Multi  Sectoral  Partnerships: Foster  cooperation  between  the  state,  private sector, universities, and social organizations to maximize the impact of interventions. In both  mentioned  cases,  the  state  established  mechanisms  that  later  functioned  in coordination with social actors to achieve integration objectives.

## Scenario of outcomes

Various  scenarios  could  arise  regarding  the  socio-urban  integration  of  informal settlements  if  these  recommendations  are  taken  into  account.  The  implementation  of socio-urban  integration  policies  could  significantly  improve  the  quality  of  life  for inhabitants of informal settlements, reducing structural poverty and social exclusion. This would lead to  greater  participation  of  these  communities  in  the  benefits  of  economic growth and increased social stability. Therefore, these policies should be seen as essential tools for addressing the habitat problems in informal settlements, which represent the cores of structural poverty in many countries, in addition to promoting planned urban development,  governments  should  focus  on  integrating  areas  where  informal  living persists.

The  recommendations  previously  outlined  focus  on  key  aspects  of  successfully implementing  socio-urban  integration  projects  based  on  experiences  that  demonstrate this.  For  instance,  the  incorporation  of  participatory  strategies  in  the  integration  of informal  settlements  is  essential  for  the  success  and  sustainability  of  these  projects. Positive experiences, such as Villa 20, demonstrate that effective community participation can transform public policy, improve the quality of life of residents, and ensure the long-term success of urban interventions. Main achievements include voting on  100%  of  urban  reconfiguration  projects,  97.6%  acceptance  and  satisfaction  with relocation, prevention of 100% of occupations of freed-up spaces, and satisfaction and appropriation of new housing by residents (Almansi et al., 2020).

This approach marks a crucial difference from historically working with this segment, ceasing to see inhabitants as mere objects of policy impact and incorporating them as stakeholders  with  a  voice  in  constructing  solutions.  Neglecting  this  will  lead  to  the

implementation of desk projects, with a low capacity for adaptation to reality and likely hindrance  in  their  implementation.  We  believe  that  implementing  a  comprehensive approach that addresses multiple dimensions of the problem will maximize the impact of investments and bring society closer to the ultimate goal of integrating settlements into cities. In this regard, our  recommendations  highlight  how  investment  in  social infrastructure contributed to reducing violence in settlements in Recife, Brazil, and the development of working lines within the CEDEL framework contributed to improving productivity in neighborhoods in Buenos Aires. Likewise, investment in basic services infrastructure had a national impact in Mexico, and the diversification of actions between improvements and the provision of new housing to resettled populations had positive impacts on improving housing conditions in the Mugica neighborhood of Buenos Aires. It is important to note that while we highlight these components as successful experiences feasible to be replicated by governments, these programs are all part of comprehensive projects  aligned  with  the  vision  we  propose.  In  addition,  these  endeavors  contribute significantly to tackling structural poverty and social exclusion. However, contradictions and challenges could also arise. For example, the adoption of a participatory approach could face resistance from certain interest groups or sectors of society benefiting from the status  quo.  Additionally,  implementing  integration  projects  could  generate  tensions  in some communities, especially if the needs and concerns of all involved are not adequately addressed.  Another  possible  scenario  is  that,  despite  efforts  to  integrate  informal settlements, some forms of exclusion and marginalization may persist due to limitations in  funding,  lack  of  institutional  capacity,  or  political  resistance.  Consequently,  even though  significant  progress  may  be  achieved,  the  complete  objectives  of  socio-urban integration may not be fully realized.

To summarize, if the recommendations are adopted, both positive advances and challenges are likely to occur in the process of socio-urban integration of informal settlements. It is crucial to anticipate and address these contradictions to ensure that implemented policies are effective and equitable.
